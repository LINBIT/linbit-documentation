==  About this guide

This guide is intended to serve users of the Distributed Replicated
Block Device (DRBD) as a definitive reference guide and handbook.

It is being made available to the DRBD community by
http://www.linbit.com/[LINBIT], the project's sponsor company, free of
charge and in the hope that it will be useful. The guide is
continuously being updated; we (the authors) try to add information
about new DRBD features simultaneously with the corresponding DRBD
releases. An on-line HTML version of this guide is always available at
http://www.drbd.org/users-guide/.

This guide may contains individual sections of this guide marked as
*Draft*. Such sections have been recently added and should not be
considered authoritative. Feedback and comments on these sections are
particularly welcome and highly encouraged.

Please use <<s-mailing-list>>the drbd-user mailing list to submit
comments.

This guide is organized in five parts and one appendix:

* <<p-intro>> deals with DRBD's basic functionality. It gives a short
  overview of DRBD's positioning within the Linux I/O stack, and about
  fundamental DRBD concepts. It also examines DRBD's most important
  features in detail.

* <<p-build-install-configure>> talks about building DRBD from
  source, installing pre-built DRBD packages, and contains an overview
  of getting DRBD running on a cluster system.

* <<p-work>> is about managing DRBD, configuring and reconfiguring
  DRBD resources, and common troubleshooting scenarios.


* <<p-apps>> deals with leveraging DRBD to add storage replication and
  high availability to applications. It not only covers DRBD
  integration in the Pacemaker cluster manager, but also advanced LVM
  configurations, integration of DRBD with GFS, and adding high
  availability to Xen virtualization environments.

* <<p-performance>> contains pointers for getting the best performance
  out of DRBD configurations.

* <<p-learn>> dives into DRBD's internals, and also contains pointers
  to other resources which readers of this guide may find useful.

* Finally, <<ap-man-pages>> contains online versions of the Linux
  manual pages distributed with the latest DRBD version, for reference
  purposes.
