[[ch-admin]]
== Common administrative tasks

This chapter outlines typical administrative tasks encountered during
day-to-day operations. It does not cover troubleshooting tasks, these
are covered in detail in <<ch-troubleshooting>>.

[[s-check-status]]
=== Checking DRBD status

[[s-drbd-overview]]
==== Retrieving status with +drbd-overview+

The most convenient way to look at DRBD's status is the
indexterm:[drbd-overview]+drbd-overview+utility. It is available since
DRBD-8.0.15 and 8.3.0. In 8.3.0 it is installed as +drbd-overview.pl+.

----------------------------
`drbd-overview`
  0:home                 Connected Primary/Secondary   UpToDate/UpToDate C r--- /home        xfs  200G 158G 43G  79%
  1:data                 Connected Primary/Secondary   UpToDate/UpToDate C r--- /mnt/ha1     ext3 9.9G 618M 8.8G 7%
  2:nfs-root             Connected Primary/Secondary   UpToDate/UpToDate C r--- /mnt/netboot ext3 79G  57G  19G  76%
----------------------------


[[s-proc-drbd]]
==== Status information in +/proc/drbd+

indexterm:[/proc/drbd]+/proc/drbd+is a virtual file displaying
real-time status information about all DRBD resources currently
configured. You may interrogate this file's contents using this
command:

----------------------------
`cat /proc/drbd`
version: 8.3.0 (api:88/proto:86-89)
GIT-hash: 9ba8b93e24d842f0dd3fb1f9b90e8348ddb95829 build by buildsystem@linbit, 2008-12-18 16:02:26
 0: cs:Connected ro:Secondary/Secondary ds:UpToDate/UpToDate C r---
    ns:0 nr:8 dw:8 dr:0 al:0 bm:2 lo:0 pe:0 ua:0 ap:0 ep:1 wo:b oos:0
 1: cs:Connected ro:Secondary/Secondary ds:UpToDate/UpToDate C r---
    ns:0 nr:12 dw:12 dr:0 al:0 bm:1 lo:0 pe:0 ua:0 ap:0 ep:1 wo:b oos:0
 2: cs:Connected ro:Secondary/Secondary ds:UpToDate/UpToDate C r---
    ns:0 nr:0 dw:0 dr:0 al:0 bm:0 lo:0 pe:0 ua:0 ap:0 ep:1 wo:b oos:0
----------------------------

The first line, prefixed with +version:+, shows the DRBD version used
on your system. The second line contains information about this
specific build.

The other four lines in this example form a block that is repeated for
every DRBD device configured, prefixed by the device minor number. In
this case, this is +0+, corresponding to the device +/dev/drbd0+.

The resource-specific output from +/proc/drbd+contains various pieces
of information about the resource:

.+cs+ (connection state)
indexterm:[connection state]Status of the network connection. See <<s-connection-states>>for details about the various connection states.

.+ro+ (roles)
indexterm:[resource]Roles of the nodes. The role of the local node is displayed first, followed by the role of the partner node shown after the slash. See <<s-roles>>for details about the possible resource roles. 
NOTE: Prior to DRBD 8.3, +/proc/drbd+used the +st+ field (referring to the ambiguous term ``state'') when referring to resource roles.

.+ds+ (disk states)
indexterm:[disk state]State of the hard disks. Prior to the slash the state of the local node is displayed, after the slash the state of the hard disk of the partner node is shown. See <<s-disk-states>>for details about the various disk states.

.+ns+ (network send)
Volume of net data sent to the partner via the network connection; in Kibyte.

.+nr+ (network receive)
Volume of net data received by the partner via the network connection; in Kibyte.

.+dw+ (disk write)
Net data written on local hard disk; in Kibyte.

.+dr+ (disk read)
Net data read from local hard disk; in Kibyte.

.+al+ (activity log)
Number of updates of the activity log area of the meta data.

.+bm+ (bit map)
Number of updates of the bitmap area of the meta data.

.+lo+ (local count)
Number of open requests to the local I/O sub-system issued by DRBD.

.+pe+ (pending)
Number of requests sent to the partner, but that have not yet been answered by the latter.

.+ua+ (unacknowledged)
Number of requests received by the partner via the network connection, but that have not yet been answered.

.+ap+ (application pending)
Number of block I/O requests forwarded to DRBD, but not yet answered by DRBD.

.+ep+ (epochs)
Number of epoch objects. Usually 1. Might increase under I/O load when using either the +barrier+ or the +none+ write ordering method. Since 8.2.7.

.+wo+ (write order)
Currently used write ordering method: +b+(barrier), +f+(flush), +d+(drain) or +n+(none). Since 8.2.7.

.+oos+ (out of sync)
Amount of storage currently out of sync; in Kibibytes. Since 8.2.6.


[[s-connection-states]]
==== Connection states

indexterm:[connection state]A resource's connection state can be
observed either by monitoring +/proc/drbd+, or by issuing the `drbdadm
cstate`command:

----------------------------
drbdadm cstate <resource>
Connected
----------------------------

A resource may have one of the following connection states: 

.+StandAlone+
indexterm:[connection state]No network configuration available. The
resource has not yet been connected, or has been administratively
disconnected (using `drbdadm disconnect`), or has dropped its
connection due to failed authentication or split brain.

.+Disconnecting+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state during disconnection. The next state is StandAlone.

.+Unconnected+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state, prior to a connection attempt. Possible next states: WFConnection and WFReportParams.

.+Timeout+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state following a timeout in the communication with the peer. Next state: Unconnected.

.+BrokenPipe+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state after the connection to the peer was lost. Next state: Unconnected.

.+NetworkFailure+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state after the connection to the partner was lost. Next state: Unconnected.

.+ProtocolError+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state after the connection to the partner was lost. Next state: Unconnected.

.+TearDown+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state. The peer is closing the connection. Next state: Unconnected.

.+WFConnection+
indexterm:[connection state]This node is waiting until the peer node becomes visible on the network.

.+WFReportParams+
indexterm:[connection state]TCP connection has been established, this node waits for the first network packet from the peer.

.+Connected+
indexterm:[connection state]A DRBD connection has been established, data mirroring is now active. This is the normal state.

.+StartingSyncS+
indexterm:[connection state]Full synchronization, initiated by the administrator, is just starting. The next possible states are: SyncSource or PausedSyncS.

.+StartingSyncT+
indexterm:[connection state]Full synchronization, initiated by the administrator, is just starting. Next state: WFSyncUUID.

.+WFBitMapS+
indexterm:[connection state]Partial synchronization is just starting. Next possible states: SyncSource or PausedSyncS.

.+WFBitMapT+
indexterm:[connection state]Partial synchronization is just starting. Next possible state: WFSyncUUID.

.+WFSyncUUID+
indexterm:[connection state]Synchronization is about to begin. Next possible states: SyncTarget or PausedSyncT.

.+SyncSource+
indexterm:[connection state]Synchronization is currently running, with the local node being the source of synchronization.

.+SyncTarget+
indexterm:[connection state]Synchronization is currently running, with the local node being the target of synchronization.

.+PausedSyncS+
indexterm:[connection state]The local node is the source of an ongoing
synchronization, but synchronization is currently paused. This may be
due to a dependency on the completion of another synchronization
process, or due to synchronization having been manually interrupted by
`drbdadm pause-sync`.

.+PausedSyncT+
indexterm:[connection state]The local node is the target of an ongoing
synchronization, but synchronization is currently paused. This may be
due to a dependency on the completion of another synchronization
process, or due to synchronization having been manually interrupted by
`drbdadm pause-sync`.

.+VerifyS+
indexterm:[connection state]On-line device verification is currently
running, with the local node being the source of verification.

.+VerifyT+
indexterm:[connection state]On-line device verification is currently
running, with the local node being the target of verification.



[[s-roles]]
==== Resource roles

indexterm:[resource]A resource's role can be observed either by
monitoring +/proc/drbd+, or by issuing the indexterm:[drbdadm]
`drbdadm role`command:

----------------------------
`drbdadm role _resource_`
Primary/Secondary
----------------------------

The local resource role is always displayed first, the remote resource
role last.

NOTE: Prior to DRBD 8.3, the `drbdadm state`command provided the same
     information. Since ``state''is an ambigious term, DRBD uses
     ``role''in its stead from version 8.3.0 forward. `drbdadm
     state`is also still available, albeit only for compatibility
     reasons. You should use `drbdadm role`.

You may see one of the following resource roles: 

.+Primary+
The resource is currently in the primary role, and may be read from
and written to. This role only occurs on one of the two nodes, unless
<<s-dual-primary-mode,dual-primary mode>> is enabled.

.+Secondary+
The resource is currently in the secondary role. It normally receives
updates from its peer (unless running in disconnected mode), but may
neither be read from nor written to. This role may occur on one node
or both nodes.

.+Unknown+
The resource's role is currently unknown. The local resource role
never has this status. It is only displayed for the peer's resource
role, and only in disconnected mode.


[[s-disk-states]]
==== Disk states

A resource's disk state can be observed either by monitoring
+/proc/drbd+, or by issuing the `drbdadm dstate` command:

----------------------------
drbdadm dstate <resource>
UpToDate/UpToDate
----------------------------

The local disk state is always displayed first, the remote disk state
last.

Both the local and the remote disk state may be one of the following:

.+Diskless+
indexterm:[disk state]No local block device has been assigned to the
DRBD driver. This may mean that the resource has never attached to its
backing device, that it has been manually detached using `drbdadm
detach`, or that it automatically detached after a lower-level I/O
error.

.+Attaching+
indexterm:[disk state]Transient state while reading meta data.

.+Failed+
indexterm:[disk state]Transient state following an I/O failure report
by the local block device. Next state: Diskless.

.+Negotiating+
indexterm:[disk state]Transient state when an Attach is carried out on
an already-connected DRBD device.

.+Inconsistent+
indexterm:[disk state]The data is inconsistent. This status occurs
immediately upon creation of a new resource, on both nodes (before the
initial full sync). Also, this status is found in one node (the
synchronization target) during synchronization.

.+Outdated+
indexterm:[disk state]Resource data is consistent, but
<<s-outdate,outdated>>.

.+DUnknown+
indexterm:[disk state]This state is used for the peer disk if no
network connection is available.

.+Consistent+
indexterm:[disk state]Consistent data of a node without
connection. When the connection is established, it is decided whether
the data are UpToDate or Outdated.

.+UpToDate+
indexterm:[disk state]Consistent, up-to-date state of the data. This
is the normal state.


[[s-enable-disable]]
=== Enabling and disabling resources

[[s-enable-resource]]
==== Enabling resources

indexterm:[resource]Normally, all resources configured in
+/etc/drbd.conf+ are automatically enabled upon system startup by the
+/etc/init.d/drbd+ init script. If you choose to disable this startup
script (as may be required by some applications), you may enable
specific resources by issuing the commands 

----------------------------
drbdadm attach <resource>
drbdadm syncer <resource>
drbdadm connect <resource>
----------------------------

or the shorthand version of the three commands above, 

----------------------------
drbdadm up resource
----------------------------

As always, you may use the keyword +all+ instead of a specific
resource name if you want to enable all resources configured in
+/etc/drbd.conf+ at once.

[[s-disable-resource]]
==== Disabling resources

indexterm:[resource]You may temporarily disable specific resources by
issuing the commands

----------------------------
drbdadm disconnect <resource>
drbdadm detach <resource>
----------------------------

or the shorthand version of the above, 

----------------------------
drbdadm down <resource>
----------------------------

NOTE: There is, in fact, a slight syntactical difference between these
      two methods. While `drbdadm down` implies a preceding
      <<s-switch-resource-roles,resource demotion>>, `drbdadm
      disconnect/detach` does not. So while you can run `drbdadm down`
      on a resource that is currently in the primary role, `drbdadm
      disconnect/detach` in the same situation will be refused by
      DRBD's internal state engine.

Here, too, you may use the keyword +all+ in place of a resource name if
you wish to temporarily disable all resources listed in
+/etc/drbd.conf+ at once.

[[s-reconfigure]]
=== Reconfiguring resources

indexterm:[resource]DRBD allows you to reconfigure resources while
they are operational. To that end,

* make any necessary changes to the resource configuration in
  +/etc/drbd.conf+,

* synchronize your +/etc/drbd.conf+ file between both nodes,

* issue the indexterm:[drbdadm]`drbdadm adjust <resource>` command on
  both nodes.

`drbdadm adjust` then hands off to `drbdsetup` to make the necessary
adjustments to the configuration. As always, you are able to review
the pending `drbdsetup` invocations by running `drbdadm` with the
+-d+ (dry-run) option.

NOTE: When making changes to the +common+ section in +/etc/drbd.conf+,
you can adjust the configuration for all resources in one run, by
issuing `drbdadm adjust all`.

[[s-switch-resource-roles]]
=== Promoting and demoting resources

indexterm:[resource]Manually switching a <<s-resource-roles,resource's
role>> from secondary to primary (promotion) or vice versa (demotion)
is done using the following commands: 

----------------------------
drbdadm primary <resource>
drbdadm secondary <resource>
----------------------------

In <<s-single-primary-mode,single-primary mode>> (DRBD's default), any
resource can be in the primary role on only one node at any given time
while the <<s-connection-states,connection state>> is
+Connected+. Thus, issuing `drbdadm primary <resource>` on one node
while _<resource>_ is still in the primary role on the peer will
result in an error.

A resource configured to allow <<s-dual-primary-mode,dual-primary
mode>> can be switched to the primary role on both nodes.

[[s-enable-dual-primary]]
=== Enabling dual-primary mode

This feature is available in DRBD 8.0 and later.

indexterm:[dual-primary mode]To enable dual-primary mode, add the
+allow-two-primaries+ option to the +net+ section of your resource
configuration:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  net {
    allow-two-primaries;
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

When a resource is configured to support dual-primary mode, it may
also be desirable to automatically switch the resource into the
primary role upon system (or DRBD) startup. To do this, add the
+become-primary-on+ option, available in DRBD 8.2.0 and above, to the
+startup+ section of your resource configuration:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  startup {
    become-primary-on both;
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

After you have made these changes to +/etc/drbd.conf+, do not forget
to synchronize the configuration between nodes. Then, proceed as
follows:

* Run `drbdadm disconnect <resource>` on both nodes.

* Execute `drbdadm connect <resource>` on both nodes.

* Finally, you may now execute `drbdadm primary _resource_` on both
  nodes, instead of on just one.


[[s-use-online-verify]]
=== Using on-line device verification

This feature is available in DRBD 8.2.5 and later.

[[s-online-verify-enable]]
==== Enabling on-line verification

indexterm:[on-line device verification]<<s-online-verify,On-line
device verification>> is not enabled for resources by default. To
enable it, add the following lines to your resource configuration in
+/etc/drbd.conf+:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  syncer {
    verify-alg <algorithm>;
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

_<algorithm>_ may be any message digest algorithm supported by the
kernel crypto API in your system's kernel configuration. Normally, you
should be able to choose at least from +sha1+, +md5+, and +crc32c+.

If you make this change to an existing resource, as always,
synchronize your +drbd.conf+ to the peer, and run `drbdadm adjust
<resource>` on both nodes.

[[s-online-verify-invoke]]
==== Invoking on-line verification

indexterm:[on-line device verification]After you have enabled on-line
verification, you will be able to initiate a verification run using
the following command:

----------------------------
drbdadm verify <resource>
----------------------------

When you do so, DRBD starts an online verification run for
_<resource>_, and if it detects any blocks not in sync, will mark
those blocks as such and write a message to the kernel log. Any
applications using the device at that time can continue to do so
unimpeded, and you may also <<s-switch-resource-roles,switch resource
roles>> at will.

If out-of-sync blocks were detected during the verification run, you
may resynchronize them using the following commands after verification
has completed:

----------------------------
drbdadm disconnect <resource>
drbdadm connect <resource>
----------------------------


[[s-online-verify-automate]]
==== Automating on-line verification

indexterm:[on-line device verification]Most users will want to
automate on-line device verification. This can be easily
accomplished. Create a file with the following contents, named
+/etc/cron.d/drbd-verify+ on _one_ of your nodes: 

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
42 0 * * 0    root    /sbin/drbdadm verify <resource>
----------------------------

This will have +cron+ invoke a device verification every Sunday at 42
minutes past midnight.

If you have enabled on-line verification for all your resources (for
example, by adding +verify-alg <algorithm> + to the +common+ section
in +/etc/drbd.conf+), you may also use:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
42 0 * * 0    root    /sbin/drbdadm verify all
----------------------------


[[s-configure-syncer-rate]]
=== Configuring the rate of synchronization

indexterm:[synchronization]Normally, one tries to ensure that
background synchronization (which makes the data on the
synchronization target temporarily inconsistent) completes as quickly
as possible. However, it is also necessary to keep background
synchronization from hogging all bandwidth otherwise available for
foreground replication, which would be detrimental to application
performance. Thus, you must configure the sychronization bandwidth to
match your hardware -- which you may do in a permanent fashion or
on-the-fly.

IMPORTANT: It does not make sense to set a synchronization rate that
is higher than the maximum write throughput on your secondary
node. You must not expect your secondary node to miraculously be able
to write faster than its I/O subsystem allows, just because it happens
to be the target of an ongoing device synchronization.

Likewise, and for the same reasons, it does not make sense to set a
synchronization rate that is higher than the bandwidth available on
the replication network.

[[s-configure-syncer-rate-permanent]]
==== Permanent syncer rate configuration

The maximum bandwidth a resource uses for background
re-synchronization is permanently configured using the +rate+ option
for a resource. This must be included in the resource configuration's
+syncer+ section in +/etc/drbd.conf+:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  syncer {
    rate 40M;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

Note that the rate setting is given in _bytes_, not _bits_ per second.

TIP: A good rule of thumb for this value is to use about 30% of the
available replication bandwidth. Thus, if you had an I/O subsystem
capable of sustaining write throughput of 180MB/s, and a Gigabit
Ethernet network capable of sustaining 110 MB/s network throughput
(the network being the bottleneck), you would calculate:

[[eq-syncer-rate-example1]]
.Syncer rate example, 110MB/s effective available bandwidth
image:syncer-rate-example1[]

Thus, the recommended value for the +rate+ option would be +33M+.

By contrast, if you had an I/O subsystem with a maximum throughput of
80MB/s and a Gigabit Ethernet connection (the I/O subsystem being the
bottleneck), you would calculate:

[[eq-syncer-rate-example2]]
.Syncer rate example, 80MB/s effective available bandwidth
image:syncer-rate-example2[]

In this case, the recommended value for the +rate+ option would be
+24M+.

[[s-configure-syncer-rate-temporary]]
==== Temporary syncer rate configuration

It is sometimes desirable to temporarily adjust the syncer rate. For
example, you might want to speed up background re-synchronization
after having performed scheduled maintenance on one of your cluster
nodes. Or, you might want to throttle background re-synchronization if
it happens to occur at a time when your application is extremely busy
with write operations, and you want to make sure that a large portion
of the existing bandwidth is available to replication.

For example, in order to make most bandwidth of a Gigabit Ethernet
link available to re-synchronization, issue the following command:

----------------------------
`drbdsetup +/dev/drbd<num>+ syncer -r 110M`
----------------------------

As always, replace _<num>_ with the device minor number of your DRBD
device. You need to issue this command on only one of your nodes.

To revert this temporary setting and re-enable the syncer rate set in
+/etc/drbd.conf+, issue this command: 
----------------------------
`drbdadm adjust _resource_`
----------------------------


[[s-configure-checksum-sync]]
=== Configuring checksum-based synchronization

indexterm:[checksum-based
synchronization]<<p-checksum-sync,Checksum-based synchronization>> is
not enabled for resources by default. To enable it, add the following
lines to your resource configuration in +/etc/drbd.conf+:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  syncer {
    csums-alg <algorithm>;
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

_algorithm_ may be any message digest algorithm supported by the
kernel crypto API in your system's kernel configuration. Normally, you
should be able to choose at least from +sha1+, +md5+, and +crc32c+.

If you make this change to an existing resource, as always,
synchronize your +drbd.conf+ to the peer, and run `drbdadm adjust
<resource>` on both nodes.

[[s-configure-io-error-behavior]]
=== Configuring I/O error handling strategies

indexterm:[I/O errors]indexterm:[drbd.conf]DRBD's
<<s-handling-disk-errors,strategy for handling lower-level I/O
errors>> is determined by the +on-io-error+ option, included in the
resource +disk+ configuration in +/etc/drbd.conf+:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  disk {
    on-io-error <strategy>;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

You may, of course, set this in the +common+ section too, if you want
to define a global I/O error handling policy for all resources.

_<strategy>_ may be one of the following options: 

. +detach+
This is the recommended option. On the occurrence of a lower-level I/O
error, the node drops its backing device, and continues in diskless
mode.

. +pass_on+
This causes DRBD to report the I/O error to the upper layers. On the
primary node, it is reported to the mounted file system. On the
secondary node, it is ignored (because the secondary has no upper
layer to report to). This is the default for historical reasons, but
is no longer recommended for most new installations — except if you
have a very compelling reason to use this strategy, instead of
+detach+.

. +call-local-io-error
Invokes the command defined as the local I/O error handler. This
requires that a corresponding +local-io-error+ command invocation is
defined in the resource's +handlers+ section. It is entirely left to
the administrator's discretion to implement I/O error handling using
the command (or script) invoked by +local-io-error+.

NOTE: Early DRBD versions (prior to 8.0) included another option,
+panic+, which would forcibly remove the node from the cluster by way
of a kernel panic, whenever a local I/O error occurred. While that
option is no longer available, the same behavior may be mimicked via
the +local-io-error+/+call-local-io-error+ interface. You should do so
only if you fully understand the implications of such behavior.


You may reconfigure a running resource's I/O error handling strategy
by following this process:

* Edit the resource configuration in +/etc/drbd.conf+.

* Copy the configuration to the peer node.

* Issue `drbdadm adjust <resource>`on both nodes.

NOTE: DRBD versions prior to 8.3.1 will incur a full resync after
running +drbdadm adjust+ on a node that is in the Primary role. On
such systems, the affected resource must be demoted prior to running
+drbdadm adjust+ after its +disk+ configuration section has been
changed.


[[s-configure-integrity-check]]
=== Configuring replication traffic integrity checking

indexterm:[replication traffic integrity
checking]<<s-integrity-check,Replication traffic integrity checking>>
is not enabled for resources by default. To enable it, add the
following lines to your resource configuration in +/etc/drbd.conf+:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  net {
    data-integrity-alg <algorithm>;
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

_<algorithm>_ may be any message digest algorithm supported by the
kernel crypto API in your system's kernel configuration. Normally, you
should be able to choose at least from +sha1+, +md5+, and +crc32c+.

If you make this change to an existing resource, as always,
synchronize your +drbd.conf+ to the peer, and run `drbdadm adjust
<resource>` on both nodes.

[[s-resizing]]
=== Resizing resources

[[s-growing-online]]
==== Growing on-line

indexterm:[resource]If the backing block devices can be grown while in
operation (online), it is also possible to increase the size of a DRBD
device based on these devices during operation. To do so, two criteria
must be fulfilled:

. The affected resource's backing device must be one managed by a
  logical volume management subsystem, such as LVM or EVMS.

. The resource must currently be in the +Connected+ connection state.

Having grown the backing block devices on both nodes, ensure that only
one node is in primary state. Then enter on one node:

----------------------------
drbdadm resize <resource>
----------------------------

This triggers a synchronization of the new section. The
synchronization is done from the primary node to the secondary node.

[[s-growing-offline]]
==== Growing off-line

indexterm:[resource]When the backing block devices on both nodes are
grown while DRBD is inactive, and the DRBD resource is using
<<s-external-meta-data,external meta data>>, then the new size is
recognized automatically. No administrative intervention is
necessary. The DRBD device will have the new size after the next
activation of DRBD on both nodes and a successful establishment of a
network connection.

If however the DRBD resource is configured to use
<<s-internal-meta-data,internal meta data>>, then this meta data must
be moved to the end of the grown device before the new size becomes
available. To do so, complete the following steps:

WARNING: This is an advanced procedure. Use at your own discretion.

* Unconfigure your DRBD resource:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
drbdadm down <resource>
----------------------------

* Save the meta data in a text file prior to shrinking: 
---------------------------- 
drbdadm dump-md _resource_ > /tmp/metadata
----------------------------

You must do this on both nodes, using a separate dump file for every
node. _Do not_ dump the meta data on one node, and simply copy the
dump file to the peer. This will not work.

* Grow the backing block device on both nodes.

* Adjust the size information ( +la-size-sect+) in the file
  +/tmp/metadata+ accordingly, on both nodes. Remember that
  +la-size-sect+ must be specified in sectors.

* Re-initialize the metadata area:

----------------------------
drbdadm create-md <resource>
----------------------------

* Re-import the corrected meta data, on both nodes:
---------------------------- 
drbdmeta_cmd=$(drbdadm -d dump-md test-disk)
${drbdmeta_cmd/dump-md/restore-md} /tmp/metadata
Valid meta-data in place, overwrite? [need to type 'yes' to confirm] 
yes
Successfully restored meta data
----------------------------

NOTE: This example uses +bash+ parameter substitution. It may or may
not work in other shells. Check your +SHELL+ environment variable if
you are unsure which shell you are currently using.

* Re-enable your DRBD resource:
----------------------------
drbdadm up <resource>
----------------------------

* On one node, promote the DRBD resource:
----------------------------
drbdadm primary <resource>
----------------------------

* Finally, grow the file system so it fills the extended size of the
  DRBD device.


[[s-shrinking-online]]
==== Shrinking on-line

indexterm:[resource]Before shrinking a DRBD device, you _must_ shrink
the layers above DRBD, i.e. usually the file system. Since DRBD cannot
ask the file system how much space it actually uses, you have to be
careful in order not to cause data loss.

NOTE: Whether or not the _filesystem_ can be shrunk on-line depends on
the filesystem being used. Most filesystems do not support on-line
shrinking. XFS does not support shrinking at all.


When using internal meta data, make sure to consider the space
required by the meta data. The size communicated to `drbdadm resize`
is the net size for the file system. In the case of internal meta
data, the gross size required by DRBD is higher (see also
<<s-meta-data-size>>).

To shrink DRBD on-line, issue the following command _after_ you have
shrunk the file system residing on top of it:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
drbdadm -- --size=<new-size> resize <resource>
----------------------------

You may use the usual multiplier suffixes for _<new-size>_ (K, M, G
etc.). After you have shrunk DRBD, you may also shrink the containing
block device (if it supports shrinking).

[[s-shrinking-offline]]
==== Shrinking off-line

indexterm:[resource]If you were to shrink a backing block device while
DRBD is inactive, DRBD would refuse to attach to this block device
during the next attach attempt, since it is now too small (in case
external meta data is used), or it would be unable to find its meta
data (in case internal meta data is used). To work around these
issues, use this procedure (if you cannot use
<<s-shrinking-online,on-line shrinking>>):


WARNING: This is an advanced procedure. Use at your own discretion.

* Shrink the file system from one node, while DRBD is still
  configured.

* Unconfigure your DRBD resource:

----------------------------
drbdadm down <resource>
----------------------------

* Save the meta data in a text file prior to shrinking:

----------------------------
drbdadm dump-md _resource_ > +/tmp/metadata+
----------------------------

You must do this on both nodes, using a separate dump file for every
node. _Do not_ dump the meta data on one node, and simply copy the dump
file to the peer. This will not work.

* Shrink the backing block device on both nodes.

* Adjust the size information ( +la-size-sect+) in the file
  +/tmp/metadata+accordingly, on both nodes. Remember that
  +la-size-sect+must be specified in sectors.

* _Only if you are using internal metadata_ (which at this time have
  probably been lost due to the shrinking process), re-initialize the
  metadata area:

----------------------------
drbdadm create-md <resource>
----------------------------

* Re-import the corrected meta data, on both nodes:

----------------------------
drbdmeta_cmd=$(drbdadm -d dump-md test-disk)
${drbdmeta_cmd/dump-md/restore-md} /tmp/metadata
Valid meta-data in place, overwrite? [need to type 'yes' to confirm]
yes
Successfully restored meta data
----------------------------

NOTE: This example uses +bash+ parameter substitution. It may or may not
work in other shells. Check your +SHELL+ environment variable if you
are unsure which shell you are currently using.

* Re-enable your DRBD resource:

----------------------------
drbdadm up <resource>
----------------------------


[[s-disable-flushes]]
=== Disabling backing device flushes

CAUTION: You should only disable device flushes when running DRBD on
devices with a battery-backed write cache (BBWC). Most storage
controllers allow to automatically disable the write cache when the
battery is depleted, switching to write-through mode when the battery
dies. It is strongly recommended to enable such a feature.

Disabling DRBD's flushes when running without BBWC, or on BBWC with a
depleted battery, is _likely to cause data loss_ and should not be
attempted.

DRBD allows you to enable and disable <<s-disk-flush-support,backing
device flushes>> separately for the replicated data set and DRBD's own
meta data. Both of these options are enabled by default. If you wish
to disable either (or both), you would set this in the +disk+ section
for the DRBD configuration file, +/etc/drbd.conf+.

To disable disk flushes for the replicated data set, include the
following line in your configuration:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  disk {
    no-disk-flushes;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------


To disable disk flushes on DRBD's meta data, include the following
line:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  disk {
    no-md-flushes;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

After you have modified your resource configuration (and synchronized
your +/etc/drbd.conf+between nodes, of course), you may enable these
settings by issuing these commands on both nodes: 

----------------------------
drbdadm down <resource>
drbdadm up <resource>
----------------------------


[[s-configure-split-brain-behavior]]
=== Configuring split brain behavior

[[s-split-brain-notification]]
==== Split brain notification

DRBD invokes the +split-brain+ handler, if configured, at any time
split brain is _detected_. To configure this handler, add the
following item to your resource configuration:

----------------------------
resource <resource>
  handlers {
    split-brain <handler>;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

_<handler>_ may be any executable present on the system. 

Since DRBD version 8.2.6, the DRBD distribution contains a split brain
handler script that installs as
+/usr/lib/drbd/notify-split-brain.sh+. It simply sends a notification
e-mail message to a specified address. To configure the handler to
send a message to +root@localhost+ (which is expected to be an email
address that forwards the notification to a real system
administrator), configure the +split-brain handler+as follows:

----------------------------
resource <resource>
  handlers {
    split-brain "/usr/lib/drbd/notify-split-brain.sh root";
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

After you have made this modification on a running resource (and
synchronized the configuration file between nodes), no additional
intervention is needed to enable the handler. DRBD will simply invoke
the newly-configured handler on the next occurrence of split brain.

[[s-automatic-split-brain-recovery-configuration]]
==== Automatic split brain recovery policies

In order to be able to enable and configure DRBD's automatic split
brain recovery policies, you must understand that DRBD offers several
configuration options for this purpose. DRBD applies its split brain
recovery procedures based on the number of nodes in the Primary role
at the time the split brain is detected. To that end, DRBD examines
the following keywords, all found in the resource's +net+ configuration
section:

.+after-sb-0pri+
Split brain has just been detected, but at this time the resource is
not in the Primary role on any host. For this option, DRBD understands
the following keywords: 

* +disconnect+: Do not recover automatically, simply invoke the
  +split-brain+handler script (if configured), drop the connection and
  continue in disconnected mode.


* +discard-younger-primary+: Discard and roll back the modifications
  made on the host which assumed the Primary role last.

* +discard-least-changes+: Discard and roll back the modifications on
the host where fewer changes occurred.

* .+discard-zero-changes+: If there is any host on which no changes
  occurred at all, simply apply all modifications made on the other
  and continue.

.+after-sb-1pri+
Split brain has just been detected, and at this time the resource is
in the Primary role on one host. For this option, DRBD understands the
following keywords:

* +disconnect+: As with +after-sb-0pri+, simply invoke the
  +split-brain+ handler script (if configured), drop the connection
  and continue in disconnected mode.

* +consensus+: Apply the same recovery policies as specified in
  +after-sb-0pri+. If a split brain victim can be selected after
  applying these policies, automatically resolve. Otherwise, behave
  exactly as if +disconnect+ were specified.

* +call-pri-lost-after-sb+: Apply the recovery policies as specified
  in +after-sb-0pri+. If a split brain victim can be selected after
  applying these policies, invoke the +pri-lost-after-sb+ handler on
  the victim node. This handler must be configured in the
  +handlers+ section and is expected to forcibly remove the node from
  the cluster.

* +discard-secondary+: Whichever host is currently in the Secondary
  role, make that host the split brain victim.

+after-sb-2pri+.
Split brain has just been detected, and at this time the resource is
in the Primary role on both hosts. This option accepts the same
keywords as +after-sb-1pri+ except +discard-secondary+and +consensus+.

NOTE: DRBD understands additional keywords for these three options,
which have been omitted here because they are very rarely used. Refer
to <<re-drbdconf>> for details on split brain recovery keywords not
discussed here. 

For example, a resource which serves as the block device for a GFS or
OCFS2 file system in dual-Primary mode may have its recovery policy
defined as follows:

----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  handlers {
    split-brain "/usr/lib/drbd/notify-split-brain.sh root"
    ...
  }
  net {
    after-sb-0pri discard-zero-changes;
    after-sb-1pri discard-secondary;
    after-sb-2pri disconnect;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------


[[s-three-nodes]]
=== Creating a three-node setup

// Available in DRBD version 8.3.0 and above

A three-node setup involves one DRBD device _stacked_ atop another.

[[s-stacking-considerations]]
==== Device stacking considerations

The following considerations apply to this type of setup:

* The stacked device is the active one. Assume you have configured one
  DRBD device +/dev/drbd0+, and the stacked device atop it is
  +/dev/drbd10+, then +/dev/drbd10+ will be the device that you mount
  and use.

* Device meta data will be stored twice, on the underlying DRBD device
  _and_ the stacked DRBD device. On the stacked device, you must always
  use <<s-internal-meta-data,internal meta data>>. This means that the
  effectively available storage area on a stacked device is slightly
  smaller, compared to an unstacked device.

* To get the stacked upper level device running, the underlying device
  must be in the primary role.

* To be able to synchronize the backup node, the stacked device on the
  active node must be up and in the primary role.


[[s-three-node-config]]
==== Configuring a stacked resource

In the following example, nodes are named +alice+, +bob+, and
+charlie+, with +alice+ and +bob+ forming a two-node cluster, and
+charlie+ being the backup node. 

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource r0 {
  protocol C;

  on alice {
    device     /dev/drbd0;
    disk       /dev/sda6;
    address    10.0.0.1:7788;
    meta-disk internal;
  }

  on bob {
    device    /dev/drbd0;
    disk      /dev/sda6;
    address   10.0.0.2:7788;
    meta-disk internal;
  }
}

resource r0-U {
  protocol A;

  stacked-on-top-of r0 {
    device     /dev/drbd10;
    address    192.168.42.1:7788;
  }

  on charlie {
    device     /dev/drbd10;
    disk       /dev/hda6;
    address    192.168.42.2:7788; # Public IP of the backup node
    meta-disk  internal;
  }
}
----------------------------

As with any +drbd.conf+configuration file, this must be distributed
across all nodes in the cluster -- in this case, three nodes. Notice
the following extra keyword not found in an unstacked resource
configuration:

.+stacked-on-top-of+
This option informs DRBD that the resource which contains it is a
stacked resource. It replaces one of the +on+ sections normally found
in any resource configuration. Do not use +stacked-on-top-of+ in an
lower-level resource.

NOTE: It is not a requirement to use <<fp-protocol-a,Protocol A>> for
stacked resources. You may select any of DRBD's replication protocols
depending on your application. 

[[s-three-node-enable]]
==== Enabling stacked resources

To enable a stacked resource, you first enable its lower-level resource and promote it:
----------------------------
drbdadm up r0
drbdadm primary r0
----------------------------

As with unstacked resources, you must create DRBD meta data on the
stacked resources. This is done using the following command: 

----------------------------
drbdadm --stacked create-md r0-U
----------------------------

Then, you may enable the stacked resource:

---------------------------
drbdadm --stacked up r0-U
drbdadm --stacked primary r0-U
----------------------------

After this, you may bring up the resource on the backup node, enabling three-node replication: 

----------------------------
drbdadm create-md r0-U
drbdadm up r0-U
----------------------------

In order to automate stacked resource management, you may integrate
stacked resources in your cluster manager configuration. See
<<s-pacemaker-stacked-resources>> for information on doing this in a
cluster managed by the Pacemaker cluster management framework.

[[s-using-drbd-proxy]]
=== Using DRBD Proxy

[[s-drbd-proxy-deployment-considerations]]
==== DRBD Proxy deployment considerations

The <<s-drbd-proxy,DRBD Proxy>> processes can either be located
directly on the machines where DRBD is set up, or they can be placed
on distinct dedicated servers. A DRBD Proxy instance can serve as a
proxy for multiple DRBD devices distributed across multiple nodes.

DRBD Proxy is completely transparent to DRBD. Typically you will
expect a high number of data packets in flight, therefore the activity
log should be reasonably large. Since this may cause longer re-sync
runs after the crash of a primary node, it is recommended to enable
DRBD's +csums-alg+ setting. 

[[s-drbd-proxy-installation]]
==== Installation

To obtain DRBD Proxy, please contact your Linbit sales
representative. Unless instructed otherwise, please always use the
most recent DRBD Proxy release.

To install DRBD Proxy on Debian and Debian-based systems, use the dpkg
tool as follows (replace version with your DRBD Proxy version, and
architecture with your target architecture):

----------------------------
dpkg -i drbd-proxy_1.0.16_i386.deb
----------------------------

To install DRBD Proxy on RPM based systems (like SLES or RHEL) use
the rpm tool as follows (replace version with your DRBD Proxy version,
and architecture with your target architecture):

----------------------------
rpm -i drbd-proxy-1.0.16-1.i386.rpm
----------------------------

Also install the DRBD administration program drbdadm since it is
required to configure DRBD Proxy.

This will install the DRBD proxy binaries as well as an init script
which usually goes into +/etc/init.d+. Please always use the init
script to start/stop DRBD proxy since it also configures DRBD Proxy
using the +drbdadm+ tool. 

[[s-drbd-proxy-license]]
==== License file

When obtaining a license from Linbit, you will be sent a DRBD Proxy
license file which is required to run DRBD Proxy. The file is called
+drbd-proxy.license+ and must be copied into the +/etc+ directory of the
target machines.

----------------------------
cp drbd-proxy.license /etc
----------------------------


[[s-drbd-proxy-configuration]]
==== Configuration

DRBD Proxy is configured in DRBD's main configuration file. It is
configured by an additional options section called +proxy+ and
additional +proxy on+ sections within the host sections. 

Below is a DRBD configuration example for proxies running directly on
the DRBD nodes:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource r0 {
        protocol A;
        device     minor 0;
        disk       /dev/sdb1;
        flexible-meta-disk  /dev/sdb2;

	proxy {
	      compression on;
	      memlimit 100M;
	}

        on alice {
                address 127.0.0.1:7789;
                proxy on alice {
                        inside 127.0.0.1:7788;
                        outside 192.168.23.1:7788;
                }
        }

        on bob {
                address 127.0.0.1:7789;
                proxy on bob {
                        inside 127.0.0.1:7788;
                        outside 192.168.23.2:7788;
                }
        }
}
----------------------------

The +inside+ IP address is used for communication between DRBD and the
DRBD Proxy, whereas the +outside+ IP address is used for communication
between the proxies.

[[s-drbd-proxy-controlling]]
==== Controlling DRBD Proxy

+drbdadm+ offers the +proxy-up+ and +proxy-down+ subcommands to
configure or delete the connection to the local DRBD Proxy process of
the named DRBD resource(s). These commands are used by the +start+ and
+stop+ actions which +/etc/init.d/drbdproxy+ implements. 

The DRBD Proxy has a low level configuration tool, called
+drbd-proxy-ctl+. When called without any option it operates in
interactive mode. The available commands are displayed by the 'help'
command. 

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
add connection <name> <ip-listen1>:<port> <ip-connect1>:<port>
   <ip-listen2>:<port> <ip-connect2>:<port>
   Creates a communication path between two DRBD instances.

set memlimit <name> <memlimit-in-bytes>
   Sets memlimit for connection <name>

del connection <name>
   Deletes communication path named name.

show
   Shows currently configured communication paths.

show memusage
   Shows memory usage of each connection.

list [h]subconnections
   Shows currently established individual connections
   together with some stats. With h outputs bytes in human
   readable format.

list [h]connections
   Shows currently configured connections and their states
   With h outputs bytes in human readable format.

list details
   Shows currently established individual connections with
   counters for each DRBD packet type.

quit
   Exits the client program (closes control connection).

shutdown
   Shuts down the drbd-proxy program. Attention: this
   unconditionally terminates any DRBD connections running.
----------------------------

[[s-drbd-proxy-troubleshoot]]
==== Troubleshooting

DRBD proxy logs via syslog using the +LOG_DAEMON+ facility. Usually
you will find DRBD Proxy messages in +/var/log/daemon.log+.

For example, if proxy fails to connect it will log something like
+Rejecting connection because I can't connect on the other side+. In
that case, please check if DRBD is running (not in StandAlone mode) on
both nodes and if both proxies are running. Also double-check your
configuration.
