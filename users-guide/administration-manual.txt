[[s-check-status]]
=== Checking DRBD status

[[s-drbd-overview]]
==== Retrieving status with +drbd-overview+

The most convenient way to look at DRBD's status is the
indexterm:[drbd-overview]+drbd-overview+ utility (lines broken here for readability).

----------------------------
nina# drbd-overview
  0:r0/0  Connected(*) Seco(*)/Prim(nina) UpTo(*)/Disk(nono) 
			/mnt ext3 1008M 18M 940M 2% 
  1:r1/0  Connected(*) Secondary(*)       UpTo(*)/Disk(nono) 
  5:r2/0  Connected(*) Seco(*)/Prim(nini) UpTo(*)/Disk(nono) 
  6:r2/1  Connected(*) Seco(*)/Prim(nini) UpTo(*)/Disk(nono) 
----------------------------

This output says that

. +r0+ volume +0+ is +Primary+ on host +nina+ (the local host), and is mounted as +ext+
  filesystem on +/mnt+.
. Host +nono+ is +Diskless+ for all resources (a <<s-drbd-client,DRBD client>>)
. All other hosts are +UpToDate+ for all resources.
. +r1+ is +Secondary+ on all hosts, ie. not used.
. +r2+ is used on host +nini+

+drbd-overview+ tries to be exact, but concise; sadly these requirements
conflict with each other, so for more complicated status outputs it might be
easier to read `drbdsetup status` directly.


[[s-proc-drbd]]
==== Status information in +/proc/drbd+

indexterm:[/proc/drbd]+/proc/drbd+ is a virtual file displaying
basic information about the DRBD module.
It was used extensively up to DRBD 8.4, but couldn't keep up
with the amount of information provided by DRBD 9.

----------------------------
$ cat /proc/drbd
version: 9.0.0 (api:1/proto:86-110) FIXME
GIT-hash: XXX build by linbit@buildsystem.linbit, 2011-10-12 09:07:35
----------------------------

The first line, prefixed with +version:+, shows the DRBD version used
on your system. The second line contains information about this
specific build.


[[s-drbdadm-status]]

indexterm:[drbdadm status]In its simplest invocation, we just ask for the
status of a single resource.

----------------------------
# drbdsetup status home
home role:Secondary
  disk:UpToDate
  nina role:Secondary
    disk:UpToDate
  nino role:Secondary
    disk:UpToDate
  nono connection:WFConnection
----------------------------

This here just says that the resource +home+ is locally, on +nina+, and
on +nino+ +UpToDate+ and +Secondary+; so the three nodes have the same
data on their storage devices, and nobody is using the device currently.

The node +nono+ is not connected, its state is reported as
+WFConnection+; please see <<s-connection-states>> below for more details.


You can get more information by passing the +--verbose+ and/or
+--statistics+ arguments:

----------------------------
# drbdadm status home --verbose --statistics
home node-id:1 role:Secondary suspended:no
    write-ordering:none
  volume:0 minor:0 disk:UpToDate
      size:1048412 read:0 written:1048412 al-writes:0 bm-writes:48 upper-pending:0 lower-pending:0 al-suspended:no blocked:no
  nina local:ipv4:10.9.9.111:7001 peer:ipv4:10.9.9.103:7010 node-id:0 connection:Connected role:Secondary
      congested:no
    volume:0 replication:Connected disk:UpToDate resync-suspended:no
        received:1048412 sent:0 out-of-sync:0 pending:0 unacked:0
  nino local:ipv4:10.9.9.111:7021 peer:ipv4:10.9.9.129:7012 node-id:2 connection:Connected role:Secondary
      congested:no
    volume:0 replication:Connected disk:UpToDate resync-suspended:no
        received:0 sent:0 out-of-sync:0 pending:0 unacked:0
  nono local:ipv4:10.9.9.111:7013 peer:ipv4:10.9.9.138:7031 node-id:3 connection:WFConnection
----------------------------


Every few lines in this example form a block that is repeated
for every node used in this resource, with small format exceptions 
for the local node - see below for more details.

The first line in each block shows the +node-id+ (for the current
resource; a host can have different ++node-id++s in different resources).
Furthermore the +role+ (see <<s-roles>>) is shown.

The next important line begins with the +volume+ specification; normally
these are numbered starting by zero, but the configuration may specify
other IDs as well. This line shows the indexterm:[connection state]
connection state in the
+replication+ item (see <<s-connection-states>> for details) and the
remote indexterm:[disk state] disk state in +disk+ (see <<s-disk-states>>).
Then there's a line for this volume giving a bit of statistics - 
data +received+, +sent+, +out-of-sync+, etc; please see
<<s-performance-indicators>> and <<s-conn-info>> for more information.

For the local node the first line shows the resource name, +home+, in our
example. As the first block always describes the local node, there is no +Connection+ or
address information.

please see the +drbd.conf+ manual page for more information.

The other four lines in this example form a block that is repeated for
every DRBD device configured, prefixed by the device minor number. In
this case, this is +0+, corresponding to the device +/dev/drbd0+.

The resource-specific output contains various pieces
of information about the resource:


.Replication protocol FIXME
Replication protocol used by the resource. Either +A+, +B+ or +C+. See
<<s-replication-protocols>> for details.


[[s-connection-states]]
==== Connection states

indexterm:[drbdadm cstate]indexterm:[connection state]A resource's connection state can be
observed either by issuing the `drbdadm cstate` command:

----------------------------
# drbdadm cstate <resource>
Connected FIXME
Connected FIXME
Connected FIXME
----------------------------

If you are interested in only a single connection of a resource, specify the connection name, too:

The default is the peer's hostname as given in the configuration file.

----------------------------
# drbdadm cstate <peer>@<resource>
Connected FIXME
----------------------------

A resource may have one of the following connection states:

.+StandAlone+
indexterm:[connection state]No network configuration available. The
resource has not yet been connected, or has been administratively
disconnected (using `drbdadm disconnect`), or has dropped its
connection due to failed authentication or split brain.

.+Disconnecting+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state during disconnection. The
next state is +StandAlone+.

.+Unconnected+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state, prior to a connection
attempt. Possible next states: +WFConnection+ and +WFReportParams+.

.+Timeout+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state following a timeout in the
communication with the peer. Next state: +Unconnected+.

.+BrokenPipe+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state after the connection to
the peer was lost. Next state: +Unconnected+.

.+NetworkFailure+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state after the connection to
the partner was lost. Next state: +Unconnected+.

.+ProtocolError+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state after the connection to
the partner was lost. Next state: +Unconnected+.

.+TearDown+
indexterm:[connection state]Temporary state. The peer is closing the
connection. Next state: +Unconnected+.

.+WFConnection+
indexterm:[connection state]This node is waiting until the peer node
becomes visible on the network.

.+WFReportParams+
indexterm:[connection state]TCP connection has been established, this
node waits for the first network packet from the peer.

.+Connected+
indexterm:[connection state]A DRBD connection has been established,
data mirroring is now active. This is the normal state.

.+StartingSyncS+
indexterm:[connection state]Full synchronization, initiated by the
administrator, is just starting. The next possible states are:
+SyncSource+ or +PausedSyncS+.

.+StartingSyncT+
indexterm:[connection state]Full synchronization, initiated by the
administrator, is just starting. Next state: +WFSyncUUID+.

.+WFBitMapS+
indexterm:[connection state]Partial synchronization is just
starting. Next possible states: +SyncSource+ or +PausedSyncS+.

.+WFBitMapT+
indexterm:[connection state]Partial synchronization is just
starting. Next possible state: +WFSyncUUID+.

.+WFSyncUUID+
indexterm:[connection state]Synchronization is about to begin. Next
possible states: +SyncTarget+ or +PausedSyncT+.

.+SyncSource+
indexterm:[connection state]Synchronization is currently running, with
the local node being the source of synchronization.

.+SyncTarget+
indexterm:[connection state]Synchronization is currently running, with
the local node being the target of synchronization.

.+PausedSyncS+
indexterm:[connection state]The local node is the source of an ongoing
synchronization, but synchronization is currently paused. This may be
due to a dependency on the completion of another synchronization
process, or due to synchronization having been manually interrupted by
`drbdadm pause-sync`.

.+PausedSyncT+
indexterm:[connection state]The local node is the target of an ongoing
synchronization, but synchronization is currently paused. This may be
due to a dependency on the completion of another synchronization
process, or due to synchronization having been manually interrupted by
`drbdadm pause-sync`.

.+VerifyS+
indexterm:[connection state]On-line device verification is currently
running, with the local node being the source of verification.

.+VerifyT+
indexterm:[connection state]On-line device verification is currently
running, with the local node being the target of verification.


[[s-roles]]
==== Resource roles

indexterm:[resource]A resource's role can be observed by issuing the
indexterm:[drbdadm role]`drbdadm role` command:

----------------------------
# drbdadm role <resource>
Primary
----------------------------

You may see one of the following resource roles:

.+Primary+
The resource is currently in the primary role, and may be read from
and written to. This role only occurs on one of the two nodes, unless
<<s-dual-primary-mode,dual-primary mode>> is enabled.

.+Secondary+
The resource is currently in the secondary role. It normally receives
updates from its peer (unless running in disconnected mode), but may
neither be read from nor written to. This role may occur on one
or both nodes.

.+Unknown+
The resource's role is currently unknown. The local resource role
never has this status. It is only displayed for the peer's resource
role, and only in disconnected mode.


[[s-disk-states]]
==== Disk states

A resource's disk state can be observed either by
issuing the `drbdadm dstate` command:

----------------------------
# drbdadm dstate <resource>
UpToDate
----------------------------

The disk state may be one of the following:

.+Diskless+
indexterm:[disk state]No local block device has been assigned to the
DRBD driver. This may mean that the resource has never attached to its
backing device, that it has been manually detached using `drbdadm
detach`, or that it automatically detached after a lower-level I/O
error.

.+Attaching+
indexterm:[disk state]Transient state while reading meta data.

.+Failed+
indexterm:[disk state]Transient state following an I/O failure report
by the local block device. Next state: +Diskless+.

.+Negotiating+
indexterm:[disk state]Transient state when an +Attach+ is carried out on
an already-+Connected+ DRBD device.

.+Inconsistent+
indexterm:[disk state]The data is inconsistent. This status occurs
immediately upon creation of a new resource, on both nodes (before the
initial full sync). Also, this status is found in one node (the
synchronization target) during synchronization.

.+Outdated+
indexterm:[disk state]Resource data is consistent, but
<<s-outdate,outdated>>.

.+DUnknown+
indexterm:[disk state]This state is used for the peer disk if no
network connection is available.

.+Consistent+
indexterm:[disk state]Consistent data of a node without
connection. When the connection is established, it is decided whether
the data is +UpToDate+ or +Outdated+.

.+UpToDate+
indexterm:[disk state]Consistent, up-to-date state of the data. This
is the normal state.


[[s-conn-info]]
==== Connection information data

.+local+
Shows the network family, the local address and port that is used to
accept connections from the peer.

.+peer+
Shows the network family, the peer address and port that is used
to connect.

.+congested+
This flag tells whether the TCP send buffer of the data connection is more than 80% filled.


[[s-performance-indicators]]
==== Performance indicators

indexterm:[performance indicators]
One line of ++drbdadm status++-output includes
the following counters and gauges:

.+send+ (network send)
Volume of net data sent to the partner via the network connection; in
Kibyte.

.+receive+ (network receive)
Volume of net data received by the partner via the network connection;
in Kibyte.

.+read+ (disk write)
Net data written on local hard disk; in Kibyte.

.+written+ (disk read)
Net data read from local hard disk; in Kibyte.

.+al-writes+ (activity log)
Number of updates of the activity log area of the meta data.

.+bm-writes+ (bit map)
Number of updates of the bitmap area of the meta data.

.+lower-pending+ (local count)
Number of open requests to the local I/O sub-system issued by DRBD.

.+pending+
Number of requests sent to the partner, but that have not yet been
answered by the latter.

.+unacked+ (unacknowledged)
Number of requests received by the partner via the network connection,
but that have not yet been answered.

.+upper-pending+ (application pending)
Number of block I/O requests forwarded to DRBD, but not yet answered
by DRBD.

.+write-ordering+ (write order)
Currently used write ordering method: +b+(barrier), +f+(flush),
+d+(drain) or +n+(none).

.+out-of-sync+
indexterm:[out-of-sync]indexterm:[oos]Amount of storage currently out of sync; in Kibibytes.

.+resync-suspended+
Whether the resynchronization is currently suspended or not. Possible values are +no+, +user+, +peer+, +dependency+.

.+blocked+
indexterm:[blocked]Shows local I/O congestion. +
--

  * +no+: No congestion.
  * +upper+: I/O _above_ the DRBD device is blocked, ie. to the filesystem. Typical causes are
    ** I/O suspension by the administrator, see the +suspend-io+ command in +drbdadm+.
    ** transient blocks, eg. during attach/detach
    ** buffers depleted, see <<p-performance>>
    ** Waiting for bitmap IO
  * +lower+: Backing device is congested.
--

It's possible to see a value of +upper,lower+, too.


[[s-enable-disable]]
=== Enabling and disabling resources

[[s-enable-resource]]
==== Enabling resources

indexterm:[resource]Normally, all configured DRBD resources are
automatically enabled

* by a cluster resource management application at its discretion,
  based on your cluster configuration, or

* by the +/etc/init.d/drbd+ init script on system startup.

If, however, you need to enable resources manually for any reason, you
may do so by issuing the command

----------------------------
# drbdadm up <resource>
----------------------------

As always, you may use the keyword +all+ instead of a specific
resource name if you want to enable all resources configured in
+/etc/drbd.conf+ at once.

[[s-disable-resource]]
==== Disabling resources

indexterm:[resource]You may temporarily disable specific resources by
issuing the command

----------------------------
# drbdadm down <resource>
----------------------------

Here, too, you may use the keyword +all+ in place of a resource name if
you wish to temporarily disable all resources listed in
+/etc/drbd.conf+ at once.

[[s-reconfigure]]
=== Reconfiguring resources

indexterm:[resource]DRBD allows you to reconfigure resources while
they are operational. To that end,

* make any necessary changes to the resource configuration in
  +/etc/drbd.conf+,

* synchronize your +/etc/drbd.conf+ file between both nodes,

* issue the indexterm:[drbdadm]`drbdadm adjust <resource>` command on
  both nodes.

`drbdadm adjust` then hands off to `drbdsetup` to make the necessary
adjustments to the configuration. As always, you are able to review
the pending `drbdsetup` invocations by running `drbdadm` with the
+-d+ (dry-run) option.

NOTE: When making changes to the +common+ section in +/etc/drbd.conf+,
you can adjust the configuration for all resources in one run, by
issuing `drbdadm adjust all`.

[[s-switch-resource-roles]]
=== Promoting and demoting resources

indexterm:[resource]Manually switching a <<s-resource-roles,resource's
role>> from secondary to primary (promotion) or vice versa (demotion)
is done using one of the following commands:

----------------------------
# drbdadm primary <resource>
# drbdadm secondary <resource>
----------------------------

In <<s-single-primary-mode,single-primary mode>> (DRBD's default), any
resource can be in the primary role on only one node at any given time
while the <<s-connection-states,connection state>> is
+Connected+. Thus, issuing `drbdadm primary <resource>` on one node
while the specified resource is still in the primary role on another node will
result in an error.

A resource configured to allow <<s-dual-primary-mode,dual-primary
mode>> can be switched to the primary role on two nodes; this is eg. needed for 
online migration of virtual machines.


[[s-manual-fail-over]]
=== Basic Manual Fail-over

If not using Pacemaker and looking to handle fail-overs manually in a
passive/active configuration, the process is as follows.

On the current primary node stop any applications or services using the DRBD device,
unmount the DRBD device, and demote the resource to secondary.

----------------------------
# umount /dev/drbd/by-res/<resource>
# drbdadm secondary <resource>
----------------------------

Now on the node we wish to make primary promote the resource and mount the device.

----------------------------
# drbdadm primary <resource>
# mount /dev/drbd/by-res/<resource> <mountpoint>
----------------------------

If you're using the +auto-promote+ feature, you don't need to change the roles 
(+Primary+/+Secondary+) manually; only stopping of the services and umounting, 
respectively mounting, is necessary.


[[s-upgrading-drbd]]
=== Upgrading DRBD

Upgrading DRBD is a fairly simple process. This section will cover
the process of upgrading from 8.4.x to 9.0.x in great detail; for within-9 
upgrades it gets to be much easier, see the short version <<s-upgrade-within-9,below>>.

[[s-upgrade-overview]]
==== General overview

The general process for upgrading 8.4 to 9.0 is as follows:

  * Configure the <<s-updating-your-repo,new repositories>> (if using packages from LINBIT)
  * Make sure that the current situation <<s-upgrade-check,is okay>>
  * <<s-upgrade-pausing-the-cluster,Pause>> any cluster manager
  * Get <<s-Upgrading-the-packages,new versions>> installed
  * If wanting to move to more than 2 nodes, then you'll need to resize the lower-level storage to provide room for the additional meta-data; this topic is discussed in the <<ch-lvm,LVM Chapter>>.
  * Deconfigure resources, unload DRBD 8.4, and <<s-upgrade-reload-kernel-mod,load the v9 kernel module>>
  *	<<s-upgrade-convert,Convert DRBD meta-data>> to format +v09+, perhaps changing the number of bitmaps in the same step
  * Take the DRBD <<s-upgrade-start-drbd,resources up>>, and be happy


[[s-updating-your-repo]]
==== Updating your repository

Due to the number of changes between the 8.4 and 9.0 branches we
have created separate repositories for each. Perform this repository
update on both servers.

[[s-RHEL-systems]]
===== RHEL/CentOS systems

Edit your +/etc/yum.repos.d/linbit.repo+ file to reflect the following
changes.

----------------------------
[drbd-9.0]
name=DRBD 9.0
baseurl=http://packages.linbit.com/<hash>/9.0/rhel6/<arch>
gpgcheck=0
----------------------------

NOTE: You will have to populate the <hash> and <arch> variables. The
<hash> is provided by LINBIT support services.

[[s-Debian-Systems]]
===== Debian/Ubuntu systems

Edit +/etc/apt/sources.list+ (or a file in +/etc/apt/sources.d/+) to reflect the 
following changes.

----------------------------
deb http://packages.linbit.com/<hash>/9.0/debian squeeze main
----------------------------

In case you're not using the +wheezy+ release, but some other, you'll need to 
change that line.

NOTE: You will have to populate the <hash> variable. The
<hash> is provided by LINBIT support services.


Next you will want to add the DRBD signing key to your trusted keys.

----------------------------
# gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys  0x282B6E23
# gpg --export -a 282B6E23 | apt-key add -
----------------------------

Lastly perform an +apt-get update+ so Debian recognizes the updated repository.

----------------------------
# apt-get update
----------------------------

[[s-upgrade-check]]
==== Checking the DRBD state

Before you begin make sure your resources are in sync. The output of
+cat /proc/drbd+ (which is only available _before_ 9.0) should show +UpToDate/UpToDate+.

----------------------------
bob# cat /proc/drbd

version: 8.4.6 (api:1/proto:86-101)
GIT-hash: 34cf172982aad70d9fe4c746f7b8dbc11837802e build by root@very, 2015-07-28 11:57:46

 0: cs:Connected ro:Secondary/Secondary ds:UpToDate/UpToDate C r-----
    ns:0 nr:211852 dw:211852 dr:0 al:0 bm:0 lo:0 pe:0 ua:0 ap:0 ep:1 wo:d oos:0
----------------------------


[[s-upgrade-pausing-the-cluster]]
==== Pausing the cluster

Now that you know the resources are in sync, start by upgrading the
secondary node. This can be done manually or if you're using
Pacemaker put the node in standby mode. Both processes are covered
below.  If you're running Pacemaker do not use the manual method.

* Manual Method
----------------------------
bob# /etc/init.d/drbd stop
----------------------------

* Pacemaker

Put the secondary node into standby mode. In this example +bob+ is secondary.

----------------------------
bob# crm node standby bob
----------------------------

NOTE: You can watch the status of your cluster using 'crm_mon -rf' or watch
'cat /proc/drbd' until it shows "Unconfigured" for your resources.


[[s-Upgrading-the-packages]]
==== Upgrading the packages

Now update your packages with either yum or apt.

----------------------------
bob# yum upgrade
----------------------------

----------------------------
bob# apt-get upgrade
----------------------------

Once the upgrade is finished will now have the latest DRBD 9.0 kernel
module and drbd-utils installed on your secondary node, +bob+. 

But the kernel module is not active yet.

[[s-upgrade-reload-kernel-mod]]
==== Loading the new Kernel module

By now the DRBD module should not be in use anymore, so we unload it via

-------------
bob# rmmod drbd
-------------

If there's a message like ++ERROR: Module drbd is in use++, then not all 
resources have been correctly stopped yet. +
Retry <<s-upgrading-drbd>>, and/or run the command ++drbdadm down all++ to find 
out which resources are still active.

Typical issues that might prevent unloading are these:

  * NFS export on a DRBD-backed filesystem (see ++exportfs -v++ output)
  * Filesystem still mounted - check ++grep drbd /proc/mounts++
  * Loopback device active (++losetup -l++)
  * Device mapper using DRBD, directly or indirectly (++dmsetup ls --tree++)
  * LVM with a DRBD-PV (++pvs++)

Please note that this list isn't complete - these are just the most common 
examples.


Now we can load the new DRBD module:

-------
bob# modprobe drbd
-------

Now you should check the contents of ++/proc/drbd++ and verify that the correct 
(new) version is loaded; if the installed packages is for the wrong kernel 
version, the ++modprobe++ would be successful, but you'd be left with the old 
version being active again.

The output of 'cat /proc/drbd' should now show 9.0.x and look similar
to this.

----------------------------
version: 9.0.0 (api:2/proto:86-110)
GIT-hash: 768965a7f158d966bd3bd4ff1014af7b3d9ff10c build by root@bob, 2015-09-03 13:58:02
Transports (api:10): tcp (1.0.0)
----------------------------

NOTE: On the primary node, alice, 'cat /proc/drbd' will still show the
prior version, until you upgrade it.

////////////////////////
At this point the cluster is running two different versions of DRBD. While this 
is not recommended to be used for longer time spans, it is inevitable for the (short) upgrade period.

 Stop
any service using DRBD and then DRBD on the primary node, alice, and promote
+bob+. Again this can be done either manually or via the Pacemaker shell.

* Manually
----------------------------
alice # umount /dev/drbd/by-res/r0
alice # /etc/init.d/drbd stop
bob # drbdadm primary r0
bob # mount /dev/drbd/by-res/r0/0 /mnt/drbd
----------------------------
Please note that the mount command now references '/0' which defines
the volume number of a resource. See <<s-recent-changes-volumes>> for
more information on the new volumes feature.

* Pacemaker
----------------------------
# crm node standby alice
----------------------------

WARNING: This will interrupt running services by stopping them and
migrating them to the secondary server, bob.

At this point you can safely upgrade DRBD by using yum or apt.

----------------------------
alice# yum upgrade
----------------------------

----------------------------
alice# apt-get upgrade
----------------------------

Once the upgrade is complete you will now have the latest version
of DRBD on alice and can start DRBD.

* Manually
----------------------------
alice# /etc/init.d/drbd start
----------------------------

* Pacemaker
----------------------------
alice# crm node online alice
----------------------------

NOTE: Services will still be located on bob and will remain there
until you migrate them back.

Both servers should now show the latest version of DRBD in a connected
state.

----------------------------
# cat /proc/drbd
version: 9.0.0 (api:2/proto:86-110)
GIT-hash: 768965a7f158d966bd3bd4ff1014af7b3d9ff10c build by root@bob, 2015-09-03 13:58:02
Transports (api:10): tcp (1.0.0)

# drbdsetup status
r0 role:Secondary
  disk:UpToDate
  bob role:Secondary
    peer-disk:UpToDate
----------------------------

////////////////////////

==== Migrating your configuration files

DRBD 9.0 is backward compatible with the 8.4 configuration files;
however, some
syntax has changed. See <<s-recent-changes-config>> for
a full list of changes. In the meantime you can port your old
configs fairly easily by using 'drbdadm dump all' command. This
will output both a new global config followed by the
new resource config files. Take this output and make changes
accordingly.

Or, even better yet - start using <<ch-admin-drbdmanage,DRBDmanage>>, which 
will provide an easy way to "take over" your active resources at some time in 
the future, to make administration even easier!


[[s-upgrade-convert]]

==== Changing the meta-data

Now you need to convert the on-disk metadata to the new version; this is really 
easy, it's just running one command and
acknowledging two questions.


If you want to change the number of nodes, you should already have increased 
the size of the lower level device, so that there is enough space to store the 
additional bitmaps; in that case, you'd run the command below with an 
additional argument ++--max-peers=__<N>__++. When determining the number of 
(possible) peers please take setups like the <<s-drbd-client>> into account.

Upgrading the DRBD metadata is as easy as running one command, and 
acknowledging the two questions:

[[s-upgrade-within-9]]
==== From DRBD 9 to DRBD 9

If you are already running 9.0, it is sufficient to 
<<s-Upgrading-the-packages,install new package versions>>, make the cluster 
node <<s-upgrade-pausing-the-cluster,+standby+>>, 
<<s-upgrade-reload-kernel-mod,unload/reload>> the kernel module, 
<<s-upgrade-start-drbd,start the resources>>, and make the cluster node 
+online+ againfootnote:[At least that's the state at the time of writing 
- that's how it has been in the past, and we want to keep it that easy. But who 
knows? Who can tell? ;)].

These individual steps have been detailed above, so we won't repeat them here.


[[s-enable-dual-primary]]
=== Enabling dual-primary mode

Dual-primary mode allows a resource to assume the primary role
simultaneously on more than one node. Doing so is possible on either a
permanent or a temporary basis.

[NOTE]
===============================
Dual-primary mode requires that the resource is configured to
replicate synchronously (protocol C). Because of this it is latency
sensitive, and ill suited for WAN environments.

Additionally, as both resources are always primary, any interruption in the
network between nodes will result in a split-brain.
===============================

WARNING: In DRBD 9.0.x Dual-Primary mode is not supported. It might work "by 
accident", but don't rely on it. Because of that, changes in the configuration
are very likely -- for example, with three Primaries the setting 
+allow-two-primaries+ is incorrect already... +
In the 9.1 series multiple Primaries will be possible and supportedfootnote:[See also the 
roadmap: http://drbd.linbit.com/home/roadmap/].

[[s-enable-dual-primary-permanent]]
==== Permanent dual-primary mode

indexterm:[multiple primaries]indexterm:[dual-primary mode]To enable dual-primary mode, set the
+allow-two-primaries+ option to +yes+ in the +net+ section of your
resource configuration:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  net {
    protocol C;
    allow-two-primaries yes;
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

After that, do not forget to synchronize the configuration between nodes. Run
++drbdadm adjust __<resource>__++ on both nodes.

You can now change both nodes to role primary at the same time with ++drbdadm
primary __<resource>__++.

[[s-enable-dual-primary-temporary]]
==== Temporary dual-primary mode

To temporarily enable dual-primary mode for a resource normally
running in a single-primary configuration, issue the following
command:

----------------------------
# drbdadm net-options --protocol=C --allow-two-primaries __<resource>__
----------------------------

To end temporary dual-primary mode, run the same command as above but with
+--allow-two-primaries=no+ (and your desired replication protocol, if
applicable).


[[s-use-online-verify]]
=== Using on-line device verification

[[s-online-verify-enable]]
==== Enabling on-line verification

indexterm:[on-line device verification]<<s-online-verify,On-line
device verification>> for resources is not enabled by default. To
enable it, add the following lines to your resource configuration in
+/etc/drbd.conf+:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  net {
    verify-alg <algorithm>;
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

+_<algorithm>_+ may be any message digest algorithm supported by the
kernel crypto API in your system's kernel configuration. Normally, you
should be able to choose at least from +sha1+, +md5+, and +crc32c+.

If you make this change to an existing resource, as always,
synchronize your +drbd.conf+ to the peer, and run `drbdadm adjust
__<resource>__` on both nodes.

[[s-online-verify-invoke]]
==== Invoking on-line verification

indexterm:[on-line device verification]After you have enabled on-line
verification, you will be able to initiate a verification run using
the following command:

----------------------------
# drbdadm verify <resource>
----------------------------

When you do so, DRBD starts an online verification run for
+_<resource>_+, and if it detects any blocks that are not in sync, will mark
those blocks as such and write a message to the kernel log. Any
applications using the device at that time can continue to do so
unimpeded, and you may also <<s-switch-resource-roles,switch resource
roles>> at will.

If out-of-sync blocks were detected during the verification run, you
may resynchronize them using the following commands after verification
has completed:

----------------------------
# drbdadm disconnect <resource>
# drbdadm connect <resource>
----------------------------


[[s-online-verify-automate]]
==== Automating on-line verification

indexterm:[on-line device verification]Most users will want to
automate on-line device verification. This can be easily
accomplished. Create a file with the following contents, named
+/etc/cron.d/drbd-verify+ on *one* of your nodes:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
42 0 * * 0    root    /sbin/drbdadm verify <resource>
----------------------------

This will have +cron+ invoke a device verification every Sunday at 42
minutes past midnight; so, if you come into the office on Monday morning,
a quick look at the resource's status would show the result. If your devices 
are very big, and the \~32 hours were not enough, then you'll notice +VerifyS+ or 
+VerifyT+ as connection state, meaning that the +verify+ is still in progress.

If you have enabled on-line verification for all your resources (for
example, by adding +verify-alg __<algorithm>__+ to the +common+ section
in +/etc/drbd.d/global_common.conf+), you may also use:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
42 0 * * 0    root    /sbin/drbdadm verify all
----------------------------


[[s-configure-sync-rate]]
=== Configuring the rate of synchronization

indexterm:[synchronization]Normally, one tries to ensure that
background synchronization (which makes the data on the
synchronization target temporarily inconsistent) completes as quickly
as possible. However, it is also necessary to keep background
synchronization from hogging all bandwidth otherwise available for
foreground replication, which would be detrimental to application
performance. Thus, you must configure the synchronization bandwidth to
match your hardware -- which you may do in a permanent fashion or
on-the-fly.

IMPORTANT: It does not make sense to set a synchronization rate that
is higher than the maximum write throughput on your secondary
node. You must not expect your secondary node to miraculously be able
to write faster than its I/O subsystem allows, just because it happens
to be the target of an ongoing device synchronization.

Likewise, and for the same reasons, it does not make sense to set a
synchronization rate that is higher than the bandwidth available on
the replication network.


==== Estimating a synchronization speed

TIP: A good rule of thumb for this value is to use about 30% of the
available replication bandwidth. Thus, if you had an I/O subsystem
capable of sustaining write throughput of 400MB/s, and a Gigabit
Ethernet network capable of sustaining 110 MB/s network throughput
(the network being the bottleneck), you would calculate:

[[eq-sync-rate-example1]]
.Syncer rate example, 110MB/s effective available bandwidth
image::sync-rate-example1[]

Thus, the recommended value for the +rate+ option would be +33M+.

By contrast, if you had an I/O subsystem with a maximum throughput of
80MB/s and a Gigabit Ethernet connection (the I/O subsystem being the
bottleneck), you would calculate:

[[eq-sync-rate-example2]]
.Syncer rate example, 80MB/s effective available bandwidth
image::sync-rate-example2[]

In this case, the recommended value for the +rate+ option would be
+24M+.

Similarly, for a storage speed of 800MB/s and a 10Gbe network connection, you 
would shoot for \~240MB/s synchronization rate.

[[s-configure-sync-rate-variable]]
==== Variable sync rate configuration

When multiple DRBD resources share a
single replication/synchronization network, synchronization with a fixed rate 
may not be an optimal approach. So, in DRBD 8.4.0 the
variable-rate synchronization was enabled by default. In this mode, DRBD uses an automated
control loop algorithm to determine, and adjust, the
synchronization rate. This algorithm ensures that there is always
sufficient bandwidth available for foreground replication, greatly
mitigating the impact that background synchronization has on
foreground I/O.

The optimal configuration for variable-rate synchronization may vary
greatly depending on the available network bandwidth, application I/O
pattern and link congestion. Ideal configuration settings also depend
on whether <<s-drbd-proxy,DRBD Proxy>> is in use or not. It may be
wise to engage professional consultancy in order to optimally
configure this DRBD feature. An _example_ configuration (which assumes
a deployment in conjunction with DRBD Proxy) is provided below:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  disk {
    c-plan-ahead 5;
    c-max-rate 10M;
    c-fill-target 2M;
  }
}
----------------------------

TIP: A good starting value for +c-fill-target+ is _BDP&times;2_, where
_BDP_ is your bandwidth-delay-product on the replication link.

For example, when using a 1GBit/s crossover connection, you'll end up with 
about 200µs latencyfootnote:[The rule-of-thumb is using the time reported by 
+ping+.]. +
1GBit/s means about 120MB/s; times 200*10^-6^ seconds gives 24000 Byte. Just round that value up to the next MB, and you're good to go.

Another example: a 100MBit WAN connection with 200ms latency means 12MB/s times 
0.2s, or about 2.5MB "on the wire". Here a good starting value for 
+c-fill-target+ would be 3MB.

Please see the +drbd.conf+ manual page for more details on the other 
configuration items.


[[s-configure-sync-rate-permanent]]
==== Permanent fixed sync rate configuration

In a few, very restricted situationsfootnote:[Like benchmarking.], it might 
make sense to just use some fixed synchronization rate. In this case, first
of all you need to turn the dynamic sync rate controller off, by using 
+c-plan-ahead 0;+.

Then, the maximum bandwidth a resource uses for background
re-synchronization is determined by the +resync-rate+ option
for a resource. This must be included in the resource's
+disk+ section in +/etc/drbd.conf+:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  disk {
    resync-rate 40M;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

Note that the rate setting is given in _bytes_, not _bits_ per second; the 
default unit is _Kibibyte_, so a value of +4096+ would be interpreted as +4MiB+.

NOTE: This just defines a rate that DRBD tries to achieve. If there is a 
bottleneck with lower throughput (network, storage speed), the defined speed 
(aka the "wished-for" performance ;) won't be reached.


==== Some more hints about synchronization

When some amount of the to-be-synchronized data isn't really in use anymore 
(eg. because files got deleted while one node wasn't connected), you
might benefit from the <<s-trim-discard>>.

Furthermore, +c-min-rate+ is easy to misunderstand - it doesn't define 
a *minimum* synchronization speed, but rather a limit below which DRBD will not 
slow down further *on purpose*. +
Whether you manage to *reach* that synchronization rate depends on your network 
and storage speed, network latency (which might be highly variable for shared 
links), and application IO (which not might be able to do anything about).


[[s-configure-checksum-sync]]
=== Configuring checksum-based synchronization

indexterm:[checksum-based
synchronization]<<p-checksum-sync,Checksum-based synchronization>> is
not enabled for resources by default. To enable it, add the following
lines to your resource configuration in +/etc/drbd.conf+:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  net {
    csums-alg <algorithm>;
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

_<algorithm>_ may be any message digest algorithm supported by the
kernel crypto API in your system's kernel configuration. Normally, you
should be able to choose at least from +sha1+, +md5+, and +crc32c+.

If you make this change to an existing resource, as always,
synchronize your +drbd.conf+ to the peer, and run ++drbdadm adjust
__<resource>__++ on both nodes.

[[s-configure-congestion-policy]]
=== Configuring congestion policies and suspended replication

In an environment where the replication bandwidth is highly variable
(as would be typical in WAN replication setups), the replication link
may occasionally become congested. In a default configuration, this
would cause I/O on the primary node to block, which is sometimes
undesirable.

Instead, you may configure DRBD to _suspend_ the ongoing replication
in this case, causing the Primary's data set to _pull ahead_ of the
Secondary. In this mode, DRBD keeps the replication channel open -- it
never switches to disconnected mode -- but does not actually replicate
until sufficient bandwidth becomes available again.

The following example is for a DRBD Proxy configuration:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  net {
    on-congestion pull-ahead;
    congestion-fill 2G;
    congestion-extents 2000;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

It is usually wise to set both +congestion-fill+ and
+congestion-extents+ together with the +pull-ahead+ option.

A good value for +congestion-fill+ is 90%

* of the allocated DRBD proxy buffer memory, when replicating over
  DRBD Proxy, or
* of the TCP network send buffer, in non-DRBD Proxy setups.

A good value for +congestion-extents+ is 90% of your configured
+al-extents+ for the affected resources.


[[s-configure-io-error-behavior]]
=== Configuring I/O error handling strategies

indexterm:[I/O errors]indexterm:[drbd.conf]DRBD's
<<s-handling-disk-errors,strategy for handling lower-level I/O
errors>> is determined by the +on-io-error+ option, included in the
resource +disk+ configuration in +/etc/drbd.conf+:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  disk {
    on-io-error <strategy>;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

You may, of course, set this in the +common+ section too, if you want
to define a global I/O error handling policy for all resources.

_<strategy>_ may be one of the following options:

.+detach+
This is the default and recommended option. On the occurrence of a
lower-level I/O error, the node drops its backing device, and
continues in diskless mode.

.+pass-on+
This causes DRBD to report the I/O error to the upper layers. On the
primary node, it is reported to the mounted file system. On the
secondary node, it is ignored (because the secondary has no upper
layer to report to).

.+call-local-io-error+
Invokes the command defined as the local I/O error handler. This
requires that a corresponding +local-io-error+ command invocation is
defined in the resource's +handlers+ section. It is entirely left to
the administrator's discretion to implement I/O error handling using
the command (or script) invoked by +local-io-error+.

NOTE: Early DRBD versions (prior to 8.0) included another option,
+panic+, which would forcibly remove the node from the cluster by way
of a kernel panic, whenever a local I/O error occurred. While that
option is no longer available, the same behavior may be mimicked via
the +local-io-error+/+call-local-io-error+ interface. You should do so
only if you fully understand the implications of such behavior.


You may reconfigure a running resource's I/O error handling strategy
by following this process:

  * Edit the resource configuration in +/etc/drbd.d/__<resource>__.res+.
  
  * Copy the configuration to the peer node.
  
  * Issue ++drbdadm adjust __<resource>__++ on both nodes.


[[s-configure-integrity-check]]
=== Configuring replication traffic integrity checking

indexterm:[replication traffic integrity
checking]<<s-integrity-check,Replication traffic integrity checking>>
is not enabled for resources by default. To enable it, add the
following lines to your resource configuration in +/etc/drbd.conf+:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  net {
    data-integrity-alg <algorithm>;
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

_<algorithm>_ may be any message digest algorithm supported by the
kernel crypto API in your system's kernel configuration. Normally, you
should be able to choose at least from +sha1+, +md5+, and +crc32c+.

If you make this change to an existing resource, as always,
synchronize your +drbd.conf+ to the peer, and run ++drbdadm adjust
__<resource>__++ on both nodes.

WARNING: This feature is not intended for production use. Enable only if you need to 
diagnose data corruption problems, and want to see whether the transport path 
(network hardware, drivers, switches) might be at fault!

[[s-resizing]]
=== Resizing resources

[[s-growing-online]]
==== Growing on-line

indexterm:[resource]If the backing block devices can be grown while in
operation (online), it is also possible to increase the size of a DRBD
device based on these devices during operation. To do so, two criteria
must be fulfilled:

. The affected resource's backing device must be one managed by a
  logical volume management subsystem, such as LVM.

. The resource must currently be in the +Connected+ connection state.

Having grown the backing block devices on all nodes, ensure that only
one node is in primary state. Then enter on one node:

----------------------------
# drbdadm resize <resource>
----------------------------

This triggers a synchronization of the new section. The
synchronization is done from the primary node to the secondary node.

If the space you're adding is clean, you can skip syncing the additional
space by using the --assume-clean option. 

----------------------------
# drbdadm -- --assume-clean resize <resource>
----------------------------

[[s-growing-offline]]
==== Growing off-line

indexterm:[resource]When the backing block devices on both nodes are
grown while DRBD is inactive, and the DRBD resource is using
<<s-external-meta-data,external meta data>>, then the new size is
recognized automatically. No administrative intervention is
necessary. The DRBD device will have the new size after the next
activation of DRBD on both nodes and a successful establishment of a
network connection.

If however the DRBD resource is configured to use
<<s-internal-meta-data,internal meta data>>, then this meta data must
be moved to the end of the grown device before the new size becomes
available. To do so, complete the following steps:

WARNING: This is an advanced procedure. Use at your own discretion.

* Unconfigure your DRBD resource:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
# drbdadm down <resource>
----------------------------

* Save the meta data in a text file prior to resizing:
----------------------------
# drbdadm dump-md <resource> > /tmp/metadata
----------------------------

You must do this on both nodes, using a separate dump file for every
node. *Do not* dump the meta data on one node, and simply copy the
dump file to the peer. *This. will. not. work.*

* Grow the backing block device on both nodes.

* Adjust the size information (+la-size-sect+) in the file
  +/tmp/metadata+ accordingly, on both nodes. Remember that
  +la-size-sect+ must be specified in sectors.

* Re-initialize the metadata area:

----------------------------
# drbdadm create-md <resource>
----------------------------

* Re-import the corrected meta data, on both nodes:
----------------------------
# drbdmeta_cmd=$(drbdadm -d dump-md <resource>)
# ${drbdmeta_cmd/dump-md/restore-md} /tmp/metadata
Valid meta-data in place, overwrite? [need to type 'yes' to confirm]
yes
Successfully restored meta data
----------------------------

NOTE: This example uses +bash+ parameter substitution. It may or may
not work in other shells. Check your +SHELL+ environment variable if
you are unsure which shell you are currently using.

* Re-enable your DRBD resource:
----------------------------
# drbdadm up <resource>
----------------------------

* On one node, promote the DRBD resource:
----------------------------
# drbdadm primary <resource>
----------------------------

* Finally, grow the file system so it fills the extended size of the
  DRBD device.


[[s-shrinking-online]]
==== Shrinking on-line


WARNING: Online shrinking is only supported with external metadata.

indexterm:[resource]Before shrinking a DRBD device, you _must_ shrink
the layers above DRBD, i.e. usually the file system. Since DRBD cannot
ask the file system how much space it actually uses, you have to be
careful in order not to cause data loss.

NOTE: Whether or not the _filesystem_ can be shrunk on-line depends on
the filesystem being used. Most filesystems do not support on-line
shrinking. XFS does not support shrinking at all.

To shrink DRBD on-line, issue the following command _after_ you have
shrunk the file system residing on top of it:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
# drbdadm resize --size=<new-size> <resource>
----------------------------

You may use the usual multiplier suffixes for _<new-size>_ (K, M, G
etc.). After you have shrunk DRBD, you may also shrink the containing
block device (if it supports shrinking).

NOTE: It might be a good idea to issue ++drbdadm resize __<resource>__++ after 
resizing the lower level device, so that the DRBD metadata *really* gets 
written into the expected space at the end of the volume.

[[s-shrinking-offline]]
==== Shrinking off-line

indexterm:[resource]If you were to shrink a backing block device while
DRBD is inactive, DRBD would refuse to attach to this block device
during the next attach attempt, since it is now too small (in case
external meta data is used), or it would be unable to find its meta
data (in case internal meta data is used). To work around these
issues, use this procedure (if you cannot use
<<s-shrinking-online,on-line shrinking>>):


WARNING: This is an advanced procedure. Use at your own discretion.

* Shrink the file system from one node, while DRBD is still
  configured.

* Unconfigure your DRBD resource:

----------------------------
# drbdadm down <resource>
----------------------------

* Save the meta data in a text file prior to shrinking:

----------------------------
# drbdadm dump-md <resource> > +/tmp/metadata+
----------------------------

You must do this on both nodes, using a separate dump file for every
node. *Do not* dump the meta data on one node, and simply copy the dump
file to the peer. *This. will. not. work.*

* Shrink the backing block device on both nodes.

* Adjust the size information (+la-size-sect+) in the file
  +/tmp/metadata+ accordingly, on both nodes. Remember that
  +la-size-sect+ must be specified in sectors.

* *Only if you are using internal metadata* (which at this time have
  probably been lost due to the shrinking process), re-initialize the
  metadata area:
+
----------------------------
# drbdadm create-md <resource>
----------------------------

* Re-import the corrected meta data, on both nodes:
+
----------------------------
# drbdmeta_cmd=$(drbdadm -d dump-md <resource>)
# ${drbdmeta_cmd/dump-md/restore-md} /tmp/metadata
Valid meta-data in place, overwrite? [need to type 'yes' to confirm]
yes
Successfully restored meta data
----------------------------

NOTE: This example uses +bash+ parameter substitution. It may or may not
work in other shells. Check your +SHELL+ environment variable if you
are unsure which shell you are currently using.

* Re-enable your DRBD resource:
+
----------------------------
# drbdadm up <resource>
----------------------------


[[s-disable-flushes]]
=== Disabling backing device flushes

CAUTION: You should only disable device flushes when running DRBD on
devices with a battery-backed write cache (BBWC). Most storage
controllers allow to automatically disable the write cache when the
battery is depleted, switching to write-through mode when the battery
dies. It is strongly recommended to enable such a feature.

Disabling DRBD's flushes when running without BBWC, or on BBWC with a
depleted battery, is _likely to cause data loss_ and should not be
attempted.

DRBD allows you to enable and disable <<s-disk-flush-support,backing
device flushes>> separately for the replicated data set and DRBD's own
meta data. Both of these options are enabled by default. If you wish
to disable either (or both), you would set this in the +disk+ section
for the DRBD configuration file, +/etc/drbd.conf+.

To disable disk flushes for the replicated data set, include the
following line in your configuration:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  disk {
    disk-flushes no;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------


To disable disk flushes on DRBD's meta data, include the following
line:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource>
  disk {
    md-flushes no;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

After you have modified your resource configuration (and synchronized
your +/etc/drbd.conf+ between nodes, of course), you may enable these
settings by issuing this command on both nodes:

----------------------------
# drbdadm adjust <resource>
----------------------------


In case only one of the serves has a BBWCfootnote:[For example, in the DR site 
you might be using different hardware, right?], you should move the setting into a host section, like this:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  disk {
	... common settings ...
  }

  on host-1 {
	disk {
	  md-flushes no;
	}
	...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------


[[s-configure-split-brain-behavior]]
=== Configuring split brain behavior

[[s-split-brain-notification]]
==== Split brain notification

DRBD invokes the +split-brain+ handler, if configured, at any time
split brain is _detected_. To configure this handler, add the
following item to your resource configuration:

----------------------------
resource <resource>
  handlers {
    split-brain <handler>;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

_<handler>_ may be any executable present on the system.

The DRBD distribution contains a split brain handler script that
installs as +/usr/lib/drbd/notify-split-brain.sh+. It simply sends a
notification e-mail message to a specified address. To configure the
handler to send a message to +root@localhost+ (which is expected to be
an email address that forwards the notification to a real system
administrator), configure the +split-brain handler+ as follows:

----------------------------
resource <resource>
  handlers {
    split-brain "/usr/lib/drbd/notify-split-brain.sh root";
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

After you have made this modification on a running resource (and
synchronized the configuration file between nodes), no additional
intervention is needed to enable the handler. DRBD will simply invoke
the newly-configured handler on the next occurrence of split brain.

[[s-automatic-split-brain-recovery-configuration]]
==== Automatic split brain recovery policies

In order to be able to enable and configure DRBD's automatic split
brain recovery policies, you must understand that DRBD offers several
configuration options for this purpose. DRBD applies its split brain
recovery procedures based on the number of nodes in the Primary role
at the time the split brain is detected. To that end, DRBD examines
the following keywords, all found in the resource's +net+ configuration
section:

.+after-sb-0pri+
Split brain has just been detected, but at this time the resource is
not in the Primary role on any host. For this option, DRBD understands
the following keywords:

* +disconnect+: Do not recover automatically, simply invoke the
  +split-brain+ handler script (if configured), drop the connection and
  continue in disconnected mode.

* +discard-younger-primary+: Discard and roll back the modifications
  made on the host which assumed the Primary role last.

* +discard-least-changes+: Discard and roll back the modifications on
the host where fewer changes occurred.

* +discard-zero-changes+: If there is any host on which no changes
  occurred at all, simply apply all modifications made on the other
  and continue.

.+after-sb-1pri+
Split brain has just been detected, and at this time the resource is
in the Primary role on one host. For this option, DRBD understands the
following keywords:

* +disconnect+: As with +after-sb-0pri+, simply invoke the
  +split-brain+ handler script (if configured), drop the connection
  and continue in disconnected mode.

* +consensus+: Apply the same recovery policies as specified in
  +after-sb-0pri+. If a split brain victim can be selected after
  applying these policies, automatically resolve. Otherwise, behave
  exactly as if +disconnect+ were specified.

* +call-pri-lost-after-sb+: Apply the recovery policies as specified
  in +after-sb-0pri+. If a split brain victim can be selected after
  applying these policies, invoke the +pri-lost-after-sb+ handler on
  the victim node. This handler must be configured in the
  +handlers+ section and is expected to forcibly remove the node from
  the cluster.

* +discard-secondary+: Whichever host is currently in the Secondary
  role, make that host the split brain victim.

.+after-sb-2pri+
Split brain has just been detected, and at this time the resource is
in the Primary role on both hosts. This option accepts the same
keywords as +after-sb-1pri+ except +discard-secondary+ and +consensus+.

NOTE: DRBD understands additional keywords for these three options,
which have been omitted here because they are very rarely used. Refer
to <<re-drbdconf#after-sb-0pri>> for details on split brain recovery keywords not
discussed here.

For example, a resource which serves as the block device for a GFS or
OCFS2 file system in dual-Primary mode may have its recovery policy
defined as follows:

----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  handlers {
    split-brain "/usr/lib/drbd/notify-split-brain.sh root"
    ...
  }
  net {
    after-sb-0pri discard-zero-changes;
    after-sb-1pri discard-secondary;
    after-sb-2pri disconnect;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------


[[s-three-nodes]]
=== Creating a stacked three-node setup

A three-node setup involves one DRBD device _stacked_ atop another.

NOTE: Stacking is deprecated in DRBD version 
9.x, as more nodes can be implemented on a single level. See 
<<s-drbdconf-conns>> for details.

[[s-stacking-considerations]]
==== Device stacking considerations

The following considerations apply to this type of setup:

* The stacked device is the active one. Assume you have configured one
  DRBD device +/dev/drbd0+, and the stacked device atop it is
  +/dev/drbd10+, then +/dev/drbd10+ will be the device that you mount
  and use.

* Device meta data will be stored twice, on the underlying DRBD device
  _and_ the stacked DRBD device. On the stacked device, you must always
  use <<s-internal-meta-data,internal meta data>>. This means that the
  effectively available storage area on a stacked device is slightly
  smaller, compared to an unstacked device.

* To get the stacked upper level device running, the underlying device
  must be in the primary role.

* To be able to synchronize the backup node, the stacked device on the
  active node must be up and in the primary role.


[[s-three-node-config]]
==== Configuring a stacked resource

In the following example, nodes are named +alice+, +bob+, and
+charlie+, with +alice+ and +bob+ forming a two-node cluster, and
+charlie+ being the backup node.

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource r0 {
  protocol C;
  device    /dev/drbd0;
  disk      /dev/sda6;
  meta-disk internal;

  on alice {
    address    10.0.0.1:7788;
  }

  on bob {
    address   10.0.0.2:7788;
  }
}

resource r0-U {
  protocol A;

  stacked-on-top-of r0 {
    device     /dev/drbd10;
    address    192.168.42.1:7789;
  }

  on charlie {
    device     /dev/drbd10;
    disk       /dev/hda6;
    address    192.168.42.2:7789; # Public IP of the backup node
    meta-disk  internal;
  }
}
----------------------------

As with any +drbd.conf+ configuration file, this must be distributed
across all nodes in the cluster -- in this case, three nodes. Notice
the following extra keyword not found in an unstacked resource
configuration:

.+stacked-on-top-of+
This option informs DRBD that the resource which contains it is a
stacked resource. It replaces one of the +on+ sections normally found
in any resource configuration. Do not use +stacked-on-top-of+ in an
lower-level resource.


NOTE: It is not a requirement to use <<fp-protocol-a,Protocol A>> for
stacked resources. You may select any of DRBD's replication protocols
depending on your application.

[[s-three-node-enable]]
==== Enabling stacked resources

To enable a stacked resource, you first enable its lower-level
resource and promote it:
----------------------------
drbdadm up r0
drbdadm primary r0
----------------------------

As with unstacked resources, you must create DRBD meta data on the
stacked resources. This is done using the following command:

----------------------------
# drbdadm create-md --stacked r0-U
----------------------------

Then, you may enable the stacked resource:

---------------------------
# drbdadm up --stacked r0-U
# drbdadm primary --stacked r0-U
----------------------------

After this, you may bring up the resource on the backup node, enabling
three-node replication:

----------------------------
# drbdadm create-md r0-U
# drbdadm up r0-U
----------------------------

In order to automate stacked resource management, you may integrate
stacked resources in your cluster manager configuration. See
<<s-pacemaker-stacked-resources>> for information on doing this in a
cluster managed by the Pacemaker cluster management framework.


[[s-rebalance-workflow]]
=== Data rebalancing

indexterm:[rebalance]Given the (example) policy that data needs to be available on 3 nodes,
you need at least 3 servers for your setup.

Now, as your storage demands grow, you will encounter the need for 
additional servers. Rather than having to buy 3 more servers at the same 
time, you can _rebalance_ your data across a single additional node.


.DRBD data rebalancing
image::rebalance[]

In the figure above you can see the _before_ and _after_ states: from 
3 nodes with three 25TiB volumes each (for a net 75TiB), to 4 nodes, 
with net 100TiB.

To redistribute the data across your cluster you have to choose a _new_ node, 
and one where you want to remove this DRBD resource. +
Please note that removing the resource from a currently _active_ node (ie. 
where DRBD is +Primary+) will involve either migrating the service or running 
this resource on this node as a <<s-drbd-client,DRBD client>>; it's easier to
choose a node in +Secondary+ role. (Of course, that might not always be possible.)


==== Prepare a bitmap slot

You will need to have a free <<s-quick-sync-bitmap,bitmap slot>> for 
temporary use, on each of the nodes that have the resource that is to be moved.

You can allocate one more at
<<s-first-time-up,`drbdadm create-md` time>>, or simply put a placeholder in 
your configuration, so that +drbdadm+ sees that it should reserve one more slot:

---------
resource r0 {
  ...
  on for-later-rebalancing {
    address   10.254.254.254:65533;
    node-id   3;
  }
}
--------

[NOTE]
=================
If you need to make that slot available during live use,
you will have to

. dump the metadata,
. enlarge the metadata space,
. edit the dumpfile,
. load the changed metadata.

In a future version `drbdadm` will have a shortcut for you; most
probably you'll be able to say +drbdadm resize --peers __N__+ and have the 
kernel rewrite the metadata for you.
=================


==== Preparing and activating the new node

First of all you have to
create the underlying storage volume on the new node (using eg. +lvcreate+).
Then the placeholder in the configuration can be filled with the correct host 
name, address, and storage path. Now copy the resource configuration to all 
relevant nodes.


On the new node initialize the meta-data (once) by doing

-------------
# drbdadm create-md <resource>
v09 Magic number not found
Writing meta data...
initialising activity log
NOT initializing bitmap
New drbd meta data block sucessfully created.
-------------


==== Starting the initial sync

Now the new node needs to get the data.

This is done by defining the network connection on the existing nodes via

-------------------------------------
# drbdadm adjust <resource>
-------------------------------------

and starting the DRBD device on the new node via

-------------------------------------
# drbdadm up <resource>
-------------------------------------


==== Check connectivity

At this time please do a
------------
# drbdadm status <resource>
------------

on the new node, and check that _all_ other nodes are connected.

==== After the initial sync

As soon as the new host is +UpToDate+, one of the
other nodes in the configuration can be renamed to +for-later-rebalancing+, and
kept for another migration.

NOTE: Perhaps you want to comment the section; although that has the risk that 
doing a `drbdadm create-md` for a new node has too few bitmap slots for the 
next rebalancing. +
It might be easier to use a reserved (unused) IP address and host name.

Copy the changed configuration around again, and use it by running

-------------------------------------
# drbdadm adjust <resource>
-------------------------------------

on all nodes.


==== Cleaning up

On the one node that had the data up to now, but isn't used anymore for this 
resource, you can now take the DRBD device down by starting

-------------------
# drbdadm down <resource>
-------------------

Now the lower level storage device isn't used anymore, and can either be 
re-used for other purposes or, if it is a logical volume, its space can be 
returned to the volume group via +lvremove+.

==== Conclusion and further steps

One of the resources has been migrated to the new node. The same could be done 
for one or more other resources, to free space on two or three nodes in the
existing cluster.

Then new resources can be configured, as there're enough nodes with free space
to achieve 3-way redundancy again.

Still, you might want to compare the steps above with the procedure when using 
DRBDmanage: <<s-dm-rebalance>>...
