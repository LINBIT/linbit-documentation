=== Measuring throughput

When measuring the impact of using DRBD on a system's I/O throughput,
the _absolute_ throughput the system is capable of is of little
relevance. What is much more interesting is the _relative_ impact DRBD
has on I/O performance. Thus it is always necessary to measure I/O
throughput both with and without DRBD.

CAUTION: The tests described in this section are intrusive; they
overwrite data and bring DRBD devices out of sync. It is thus vital
that you perform them only on scratch volumes which can be discarded
after testing has completed.

I/O throughput estimation works by writing significantly large chunks
of data to a block device, and measuring the amount of time the system
took to complete the write operation. This can be easily done using a
fairly ubiquitous utility, `dd`, whose reasonably recent versions
include a built-in throughput estimation.

A simple ``dd``-based throughput benchmark, assuming you have a scratch
resource named `test` which is currently connected and in the
secondary role on both nodes, is one like the following:

[source,drbd]
----
# TEST_RESOURCE=test
# TEST_DEVICE=$(drbdadm sh-dev $TEST_RESOURCE)
# TEST_LL_DEVICE=$(drbdadm sh-ll-dev $TEST_RESOURCE)
# drbdadm primary $TEST_RESOURCE
# for i in $(seq 5); do
    dd if=/dev/zero of=$TEST_DEVICE bs=512M count=1 oflag=direct
  done
# drbdadm down $TEST_RESOURCE
# for i in $(seq 5); do
    dd if=/dev/zero of=$TEST_LL_DEVICE bs=512M count=1 oflag=direct
  done
----

This test simply writes a 512M chunk of data to your DRBD device, and
then to its backing device for comparison. Both tests are repeated 5
times each to allow for some statistical averaging. The relevant
result is the throughput measurements generated by `dd`.

NOTE: For freshly enabled DRBD devices, it is normal to see
significantly reduced performance on the first `dd` run. This is due
to the Activity Log being "cold", and is no cause for concern.

[[s-measure-latency]]
=== Measuring latency

Latency measurements have objectives completely different from
throughput benchmarks: in I/O latency tests, one writes a very small
chunk of data (ideally the smallest chunk of data that the system can
deal with), and observes the time it takes to complete that write. The
process is usually repeated several times to account for normal
statistical fluctuations.

Just as throughput measurements, I/O latency measurements may be
performed using the ubiquitous `dd` utility, albeit with different
settings and an entirely different focus of observation.

Provided below is a simple ``dd``-based latency micro-benchmark,
assuming you have a scratch resource named `test` which is currently
connected and in the secondary role on both nodes:

[source,drbd]
----
# TEST_RESOURCE=test
# TEST_DEVICE=$(drbdadm sh-dev $TEST_RESOURCE)
# TEST_LL_DEVICE=$(drbdadm sh-ll-dev $TEST_RESOURCE)
# drbdadm primary $TEST_RESOURCE
# dd if=/dev/zero of=$TEST_DEVICE bs=512 count=1000 oflag=direct
# drbdadm down $TEST_RESOURCE
# dd if=/dev/zero of=$TEST_LL_DEVICE bs=512 count=1000 oflag=direct
----

This test writes 1,000 512-byte chunks of data to your DRBD device,
and then to its backing device for comparison. 512 bytes is the
smallest block size a Linux system (on all architectures except s390)
is expected to handle.

It is important to understand that throughput measurements generated
by `dd` are completely irrelevant for this test; what is important is
the _time_ elapsed during the completion of said 1,000 writes. Dividing
this time by 1,000 gives the average latency of a single sector write.
