== Integrating DRBD with Heartbeat clusters

indexterm:[Heartbeat]

IMPORTANT: This chapter talks about DRBD in combination with the
legacy Linux-HA cluster manager found in Heartbeat 2.0 and 2.1. That
cluster manager has been superseded by Pacemaker and the latter should
be used whenever possible â€” please see <<ch-pacemaker>>for more
information. This chapter outlines legacy Heartbeat configurations and
is intended for users who must maintain existing legacy Heartbeat
systems for policy reasons.

The Heartbeat _cluster messaging layer_, a distinct part of the
Linux-HA project that continues to be supported as of Heartbeat
version 3, is fine to use in conjunction with the Pacemaker cluster
manager. More information about configuring Heartbeat can be found as
part of the Linux-HA User's Guide at http://www.linux-ha.org/doc/[].

[[s-heartbeat-cluster-manager]]
==== The Heartbeat cluster manager

indexterm:[Heartbeat]Heartbeat's purpose as a cluster manager is to
ensure that the cluster maintains its services to the clients, even if
single machines of the cluster fail. Applications that may be managed
by Heartbeat as cluster services include, for example,

* a web server such as Apache,
* a database server such as MySQL, Oracle, or PostgreSQL,
* a file server such as NFS or Samba, and many others.

In essence, any server application may be managed by Heartbeat as a
cluster service.

Services managed by Heartbeat are typically removed from the system
startup configuration; rather than being started at boot time, the
cluster manager starts and stops them as required by the cluster
configuration and status. If a machine (a physical cluster node) fails
while running a particular set of services, Heartbeat will start the
failed services on another machine in the cluster. These operations
performed by Heartbeat are commonly referred to as (automatic)
indexterm:[fail-over]_fail-over_.

A migration of cluster services from one cluster node to another, by
manual intervention, is commonly termed "manual fail-over". This being
a slightly self-contradictory term, we use the alternative term
indexterm:[switch-over]indexterm:[fail-over]_switch-over_ for the
purposes of this guide.

Heartbeat is also capable of automatically migrating resources back to
a previously failed node, as soon as the latter recovers. This process
is called indexterm:[fail-back]_fail-back_.

[[s-heartbeat-resources]]
==== Heartbeat resources

indexterm:[Heartbeat]indexterm:[resource (Heartbeat)]Usually, there
will be certain requirements in order to be able to start a cluster
service managed by Heartbeat on a node. Consider the example of a
typical database-driven web application:

* Both the web server and the database server assume that their
  designated _IP addresses_ are available (i.e. configured) on the
  node.
* The database will require a _file system_ to retrieve data files
  from.
* That file system will require its underlying _block device_ to read
  from and write to (this is where DRBD comes in, as we will see
  later).
* The web server will also depend on the database being started,
  assuming it cannot serve dynamic content without an available
  database.

The services Heartbeat controls, and any additional requirements those
services depend on, are referred to as _resources_ in Heartbeat
terminology. Where resources form a co-dependent collection, that
collection is called a _resource group_.

[[s-resource-agents]]
==== Heartbeat resource agents

indexterm:[Heartbeat]indexterm:[resource agent (Heartbeat)]Heartbeat
manages resources by way of invoking standardized shell scripts known
as _resource agents_ (RA's). In Heartbeat clusters, the following
resource agent types are available:

[[fp-heartbeat-ra]]
.Heartbeat resource agents
These agents are found in the `/etc/ha.d/resource.d` directory. They
may take zero or more positional, unnamed parameters, and one
operation argument ( `start`, `stop`, or `status`). Heartbeat
translates resource parameters it finds for a matching resource in
`/etc/ha.d/haresources` into positional parameters for the RA, which
then uses these to configure the resource.

[[fp-lsb-ra]]
.LSB resource agents
These are conventional, Linux Standard Base-compliant init scripts
found in `/etc/init.d`, which Heartbeat simply invokes with the
`start`, `stop`, or `status` argument. They take no positional
parameters. Thus, the corresponding resources' configuration cannot be
managed by Heartbeat; these services are expected to be configured by
conventional configuration files.

[[fp-ocf-ra]]
.OCF resource agents
These are resource agents that conform to the guidelines of the Open
Cluster Framework, and they _only_ work with clusters in CRM mode. They
are usually found in either `/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat` or
`/usr/lib64/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat`, depending on system
architecture and distribution. They take no positional parameters, but
may be extensively configured via environment variables that the
cluster management process derives from the cluster configuration, and
passes in to the resource agent upon invocation.


[[s-heartbeat-communication-channels]]
==== Heartbeat communication channels

indexterm:[Heartbeat]indexterm:[communication channels
(Heartbeat)]Heartbeat uses a UDP-based communication protocol to
periodically check for node availability (the "heartbeat" proper). For
this purpose, Heartbeat can use several communication methods,
including:

* IP multicast,
* IP broadcast,
* IP unicast,
* serial line.

Of these, IP multicast and IP broadcast are the most relevant in
practice. The absolute minimum requirement for stable cluster
operation is two independent communication channels.

IMPORTANT: A bonded network interface (a virtual aggregation of
physical interfaces using the indexterm:[bonding
driver]`bonding` driver) constitutes _one_ Heartbeat communication
channel.

Bonded links are not protected against bugs, known or as-yet-unknown,
in the `bonding` driver. Also, bonded links are typically formed using
identical network interface models, thus they are vulnerable to bugs
in the NIC driver as well. Any such issue could lead to a cluster
partition if no independent second Heartbeat communication channel
were available.

It is thus _not_ acceptable to omit the inclusion of a second
Heartbeat link in the cluster configuration just because the first
uses a bonded interface.


[[s-heartbeat-config]]
=== Heartbeat configuration

indexterm:[Heartbeat]For any Heartbeat cluster, the following
configuration files must be available:

* indexterm:[ha.cf (Heartbeat configuration file)]`/etc/ha.d/ha.cf` --
  global cluster configuration.

* indexterm:[authkeys (Heartbeat configuration
  file)]`/etc/ha.d/authkeys` -- keys for mutual node authentication.

Depending on whether Heartbeat is running in R1-compatible or in CRM
mode, additional configuration files are required. These are covered
in <<s-heartbeat-r1>> and <<s-heartbeat-crm>>.

[[s-heartbeat-hacf]]
==== The `ha.cf` file

indexterm:[ha.cf (Heartbeat configuration file)]The following example
is a small and simple `ha.cf` file:

[source,drbd]
----
autojoin none
mcast bond0 239.0.0.43 694 1 0
bcast eth2
warntime 5
deadtime 15
initdead 60
keepalive 2
node alice
node bob
----

Setting `autojoin` to `none` disables cluster node auto-discovery and
requires that cluster nodes be listed explicitly, using the
`node` options. This speeds up cluster start-up in clusters with a
fixed number of nodes (which is always the case in R1-style Heartbeat
clusters).

This example assumes that `bond0` is the cluster's interface to the
shared network, and that `eth2` is the interface dedicated for DRBD
replication between both nodes. Thus, `bond0` can be used for
Multicast heartbeat, whereas on `eth2` broadcast is acceptable as
`eth2` is not a shared network.

The next options configure node failure detection. They set the time
after which Heartbeat issues a warning that a no longer available peer
node _may_ be dead ( `warntime`), the time after which Heartbeat
considers a node _confirmed_ dead ( `deadtime`), and the maximum time
it waits for other nodes to check in at cluster startup (
`initdead`). `keepalive` sets the interval at which Heartbeat
keep-alive packets are sent. All these options are given in seconds.

The `node` option identifies cluster members. The option values listed
here must match the exact host names of cluster nodes as given by
`uname -n`.

Not adding a `crm` option implies that the cluster is operating in
<<s-heartbeat-r1,R1-compatible mode>> with CRM disabled. If `crm yes`
were included in the configuration, Heartbeat would be running in
<<s-heartbeat-crm,CRM mode>>.

[[s-heartbeat-authkeys]]
==== The `authkeys` file

indexterm:[authkeys (Heartbeat configuration
file)]`/etc/ha.d/authkeys` contains pre-shared secrets used for mutual
cluster node authentication. It should only be readable by `root` and
follows this format:

[source,drbd]
----
auth <num>
<num> <algorithm> <secret>
----


_<num>_ is a simple key index, starting with 1. Usually, you will only
have one key in your `authkeys` file.

_<algorithm>_ is the signature algorithm being used. You may use either
`md5` or `sha1`; the use of `crc` (a simple cyclic redundancy check,
not secure) is not recommended.

_<secret>_ is the actual authentication key.

You may create an `authkeys` file, using a generated secret, with the
following shell hack:

[source,bash]
----
( echo -ne "auth 1\n1 sha1 "; \
  dd if=/dev/urandom bs=512 count=1 | openssl md5 ) \
  > /etc/ha.d/authkeys
chmod 0600 /etc/ha.d/authkeys
----

[[s-heartbeat-ha-propagate]]
==== Propagating the cluster configuration to cluster nodes

In order to propagate the contents of the `ha.cf` and `authkeys`
configuration files, you may use the `ha_propagate` command, which you
would invoke using either

----
/usr/lib/heartbeat/ha_propagate
----

or

----
/usr/lib64/heartbeat/ha_propagate
----


This utility will copy the configuration files over to any `node`
listed in `/etc/ha.d/ha.cf` using `scp`. It will afterwards also
connect to the nodes using `ssh` and issue `chkconfig heartbeat on` in
order to enable Heartbeat services on system startup.

[[s-heartbeat-r1]]
=== Using DRBD in Heartbeat R1-style clusters

Running Heartbeat clusters in release 1 compatible configuration is
now considered obsolete by the Linux-HA development team. However, it
is still widely used in the field, which is why it is documented here
in this section.

[[fp-heartbeat-r1-advantages]]
.Advantages

Configuring Heartbeat in R1 compatible mode has some advantages over
using CRM configuration. In particular,

* Heartbeat R1 compatible clusters are simple and easy to configure;
* it is fairly straightforward to extend Heartbeat's functionality
  with custom, R1-style resource agents.

[[fp-heartbeat-r1-disadvantages]]
.Disadvantages

Disadvantages of R1 compatible configuration, as opposed to CRM
configurations, include:

* Cluster configuration must be manually kept in sync between cluster
  nodes, it is not propagated automatically.
* While node monitoring is available, resource-level monitoring is
  not. Individual resources must be monitored by an external
  monitoring system.
* Resource group support is limited to two resource groups. CRM
  clusters, by contrast, support any number, and also come with a
  complex resource-level constraint framework.

Another disadvantage, namely the fact that R1 style configuration
limits cluster size to 2 nodes (whereas CRM clusters support up to
255) is largely irrelevant for setups involving DRBD, DRBD itself
being limited to two nodes.


[[s-heartbeat-r1-config]]
==== Heartbeat R1-style configuration

In R1-style clusters, Heartbeat keeps its complete configuration in
three simple configuration files:

* `/etc/ha.d/ha.cf`, as described in <<s-heartbeat-hacf>>.
* `/etc/ha.d/authkeys`, as described in <<s-heartbeat-authkeys>>.
* `/etc/ha.d/haresources` -- the resource configuration file,
  described below.

[[s-heartbeat-haresources]]
===== The `haresources` file

indexterm:[haresources (Heartbeat configuration file)]The following is
an example of a Heartbeat R1-compatible resource configuration
involving a MySQL database backed by DRBD:

[source,drbd]
----
bob drbddisk::mysql Filesystem::/dev/drbd0::/var/lib/mysql::ext3 \
    10.9.42.1 mysql
----


This resource configuration contains one resource group whose _home
node_ (the node where its resources are expected to run under normal
circumstances) is named 'bob'. Consequently, this resource group
would be considered the _local_ resource group on host 'bob', whereas
it would be the _foreign_ resource group on its peer host.

The resource group includes a DRBD resource named `mysql`, which will
be promoted to the primary role by the cluster manager (specifically,
the `drbddisk` <<fp-heartbeat-ra,resource agent>>) on whichever node
is currently the active node. Of course, a corresponding resource must
exist and be configured in `/etc/drbd.conf` for this to work.

That DRBD resource translates to the block device named `/dev/drbd0`,
which contains an ext3 filesystem that is to be mounted at
`/var/lib/mysql` (the default location for MySQL data files).

The resource group also contains a service IP address,
10.9.42.1. Heartbeat will make sure that this IP address is configured
and available on whichever node is currently active.

Finally, Heartbeat will use the <<fp-lsb-ra,LSB resource agent>> named
`mysql` in order to start the MySQL daemon, which will then find its
data files at `/var/lib/mysql` and be able to listen on the service IP
address, 192.168.42.1.

It is important to understand that the resources listed in the
`haresources` file are always evaluated from left to right when
resources are being started, and from right to left when they are
being stopped.

[[s-heartbeat-stacked]]
===== Stacked resources in Heartbeat R1-style configurations

In <<s-three-way-repl,three-way replication>> with stacked resources,
it is usually desirable to have the stacked resource managed by
Heartbeat just as other cluster resources. Then, your two-node cluster
will manage the stacked resource as a floating resource that runs on
whichever node is currently the active one in the cluster. The third
node, which is set aside from the Heartbeat cluster, will have the
"other half" of the stacked resource available permanently.

NOTE: To have a stacked resource managed by Heartbeat, you must first
configure it as outlined in <<s-three-node-config>>.

The stacked resource is managed by Heartbeat by way of the `drbdupper`
resource agent. That resource agent is distributed, as all other
Heartbeat R1 resource agents, in `/etc/ha.d/resource.d`. It is to
stacked resources what the `drbddisk` resource agent is to
conventional, unstacked resources.

`drbdupper` takes care of managing both the lower-level resource
_and_ the stacked resource. Consider the following `haresources`
example, which would replace the one given in the previous section:

[source,drbd]
----
bob 192.168.42.1 \
  drbdupper::mysql-U Filesystem::/dev/drbd1::/var/lib/mysql::ext3 \
  mysql
----

Note the following differences to the earlier example:

* You start the cluster IP address _before_ all other resources. This
  is necessary because stacked resource replication uses a connection
  from the cluster IP address to the node IP address of the third
  node. Lower-level resource replication, by contrast, uses a
  connection between the "physical" node IP addresses of the two cluster nodes.

* You pass the stacked resource name to `drbdupper` (in this example,
  `mysql-U`).

* You configure the `Filesystem` resource agent to mount the DRBD
  device associated with the stacked resource (in this example,
  `/dev/drbd1`), not the lower-level one.

[[s-heartbeat-r1-manage]]
==== Managing Heartbeat R1-style clusters

[[s-heartbeat-r1-assume-resources]]
===== Assuming control of cluster resources

A Heartbeat R1-style cluster node may assume control of cluster
resources in the following way:

[[fp-heartbeat-r1-manual-resource-takeover]]
.Manual resource takeover
This is the approach normally taken if one simply wishes to test
resource migration, or assume control of resources for any reason
other than the peer having to leave the cluster. This operation is
performed using the following command:

----
`/usr/lib/heartbeat/hb_takeover`
----

On some distributions and architectures, you may be required to enter:

----
`/usr/lib64/heartbeat/hb_takeover`
----


[[s-heartbeat-r1-relinquish-resources]]
===== Relinquishing cluster resources

A Heartbeat R1-style cluster node may be forced to give up its
resources in several ways.

.Switching a cluster node to standby mode
This is the approach normally taken if one simply wishes to test
resource migration, or perform some other activity that does not
require the node to leave the cluster. This operation is performed
using the following command:
----
/usr/lib/heartbeat/hb_standby
----
On some distributions and architectures, you may be required to enter:
----
/usr/lib64/heartbeat/hb_standby
----

[[fp-heartbeat-r1-shutdown-local-cluster-manager]]
.Shutting down the local cluster manager instance

This approach is suited for local maintenance operations such as
software updates which require that the node be temporarily removed
from the cluster, but which do not necessitate a system reboot. It
involves shutting down all processes associated with the local cluster
manager instance:
----
/etc/init.d/heartbeat stop
----

Prior to stopping its services, Heartbeat will gracefully migrate any
currently running resources to the peer node. This is the approach to
be followed, for example, if you are upgrading DRBD to a new release,
without also upgrading your kernel.

[[fp-heartbeat-r1-shutdown-local-node]]
.Shutting down the local node
For hardware maintenance or other interventions that require a system
shutdown or reboot, use a simple graceful shutdown command, such as

----
reboot
----
or
----
poweroff
----

Since Heartbeat services will be shut down gracefully in the process
of a normal system shutdown, the previous paragraph applies to this
situation, too. This is also the approach you would use in case of a
kernel upgrade (which also requires the installation of a matching
DRBD version).


[[s-heartbeat-crm]]
=== Using DRBD in Heartbeat CRM-enabled clusters

Running Heartbeat clusters in CRM configuration mode is the
recommended approach as of Heartbeat release 2 (per the Linux-HA
development team).

[[fp-heartbeat-crm-advantages]]
.Advantages
Advantages of using CRM configuration mode, as opposed to R1
compatible configuration, include:

* Cluster configuration is distributed cluster-wide and automatically,
  by the Cluster Resource Manager. It needs not to be propagated manually.

* CRM mode supports both node-level and resource-level monitoring, and
  configurable responses to both node and resource failure. It is
  still advisable to also monitor cluster resources using an external
  monitoring system.

* CRM clusters support any number of resource groups, as opposed to
  Heartbeat R1-style clusters which only support two.

* CRM clusters support a powerful (if complex) constraints
  framework. This enables you to ensure correct resource startup and
  shutdown order, resource co-location (forcing resources to always
  run on the same physical node), and to set preferred nodes for
  particular resources.

Another advantage, namely the fact that CRM clusters support up to 255
nodes in a single cluster, is somewhat irrelevant for setups involving
DRBD (DRBD itself being limited to two nodes).

[[fp-heartbeat-crm-disadvantages]]
.Disadvantages
Configuring Heartbeat in CRM mode also has some disadvantages in
comparison to using R1-compatible configuration. In particular,

* Heartbeat CRM clusters are comparatively complex to configure and
  administer;
* Extending Heartbeat's functionality with custom OCF resource agents
is non-trivial.

NOTE: This disadvantage is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you do
have the option of using custom (or legacy) R1-style resource agents
in CRM clusters.


[[s-heartbeat-crm-config]]
==== Heartbeat CRM configuration

In CRM clusters, Heartbeat keeps part of configuration in the
following configuration files:

* indexterm:[ha.cf (Heartbeat configuration file)]`/etc/ha.d/ha.cf`,
as described in <<s-heartbeat-hacf>>. You must include the following
line in this configuration file to enable CRM mode:
[source,drbd]
----
crm yes
----

* indexterm:[authkeys (Heartbeat configuration
  file)]`/etc/ha.d/authkeys`. The contents of this file are the same
  as for R1 style clusters. See <<s-heartbeat-authkeys>> for details.

The remainder of the cluster configuration is maintained in the
_Cluster Information Base_ (CIB), covered in detail in
<<s-heartbeat-cib,the following section>>. Contrary to the two
relevant configuration files, the CIB need not be manually distributed
among cluster nodes; the Heartbeat services take care of that
automatically.

[[s-heartbeat-cib]]
===== The Cluster Information Base

indexterm:[Heartbeat]indexterm:[Cluster Information Base (CIB)] The
Cluster Information Base (CIB) is kept in one XML file,
indexterm:[cib.xml (Heartbeat configuration
file)]`/var/lib/heartbeat/crm/cib.xml`. It is, however, not
recommended to edit the contents of this file directly, except in the
case of creating a new cluster configuration from scratch. Instead,
Heartbeat comes with both command-line applications and a GUI to
modify the CIB.

The CIB actually contains both the cluster _configuration_ (which is
persistent and is kept in the `cib.xml` file), and information about
the current cluster _status_ (which is volatile). Status information,
too, may be queried either using Heartbeat command-line tools, and the
Heartbeat GUI.

After creating a new Heartbeat CRM cluster -- that is, creating the
`ha.cf` and `authkeys` files, distributing them among cluster nodes,
starting Heartbeat services, and waiting for nodes to establish
intra-cluster communications -- new, empty CIB is created
automatically. Its contents will be similar to this:

[source,xml]
----
<cib>
   <configuration>
     <crm_config>
       <cluster_property_set id="cib-bootstrap-options">
         <attributes/>
       </cluster_property_set>
     </crm_config>
     <nodes>
       <node uname="alice" type="normal"
             id="f11899c3-ed6e-4e63-abae-b9af90c62283"/>
       <node uname="bob" type="normal"
             id="663bae4d-44a0-407f-ac14-389150407159"/>
     </nodes>
     <resources/>
     <constraints/>
   </configuration>
 </cib>
----

The exact format and contents of this file are documented at length
http://www.linux-ha.org/ClusterInformationBase/UserGuide[on the
Linux-HA web site], but for practical purposes it is important to
understand that this cluster has two nodes named 'alice' and 'bob', and
that neither any resources nor any resource constraints have been
configured at this point.

[[s-heartbeat-crm-drbd-backed-service]]
===== Adding a DRBD-backed service to the cluster configuration

This section explains how to enable a DRBD-backed service in a
Heartbeat CRM cluster. The examples used in this section mimic, in
functionality, those described in <<s-heartbeat-resources>>, dealing
with R1-style Heartbeat clusters.

The complexity of the configuration steps described in this section
may seem overwhelming to some, particularly those having previously
dealt only with R1-style Heartbeat configurations. While the
configuration of Heartbeat CRM clusters is indeed complex (and
sometimes not very user-friendly), <<fp-heartbeat-crm-advantages,the
CRM's advantages>> may outweigh <<fp-heartbeat-r1-advantages,those of
R1-style clusters>>. Which approach to follow is entirely up to the
administrator's discretion.

[[s-heartbeat-crm-drbddisk-ra]]
====== Using the `drbddisk` resource agent in a Heartbeat CRM configuration

Even though you are using Heartbeat in CRM mode, you may still utilize
R1-compatible resource agents such as `drbddisk`. This resource agent
provides no secondary node monitoring, and ensures only resource
promotion and demotion.

In order to enable a DRBD-backed configuration for a MySQL database in
a Heartbeat CRM cluster with `drbddisk`, you would use a configuration
like this:

[source,xml]
----
<group ordered="true" collocated="true" id="rg_mysql">
  <primitive class="heartbeat" type="drbddisk"
             provider="heartbeat" id="drbddisk_mysql">
    <meta_attributes>
      <attributes>
        <nvpair name="target_role" value="started"/>
      </attributes>
    </meta_attributes>
    <instance_attributes>
      <attributes>
        <nvpair name="1" value="mysql"/>
      </attributes>
    </instance_attributes>
  </primitive>
  <primitive class="ocf" type="Filesystem"
             provider="heartbeat" id="fs_mysql">
    <instance_attributes>
      <attributes>
        <nvpair name="device" value="/dev/drbd0"/>
        <nvpair name="directory" value="/var/lib/mysql"/>
        <nvpair name="type" value="ext3"/>
      </attributes>
    </instance_attributes>
  </primitive>
  <primitive class="ocf" type="IPaddr2"
             provider="heartbeat" id="ip_mysql">
    <instance_attributes>
      <attributes>
        <nvpair name="ip" value="192.168.42.1"/>
        <nvpair name="cidr_netmask" value="24"/>
        <nvpair name="nic" value="eth0"/>
      </attributes>
    </instance_attributes>
  </primitive>
  <primitive class="lsb" type="mysqld"
             provider="heartbeat" id="mysqld"/>
</group>
----


Assuming you created this configuration in a temporary file named
`/tmp/hb_mysql.xml`, you would add this resource group to the cluster
configuration using the following command (on any cluster node):
indexterm:[Heartbeat]indexterm:[cibadmin (Heartbeat command)]
----
cibadmin -o resources -C -x /tmp/hb_mysql.xml
----

After this, Heartbeat will automatically propagate the
newly-configured resource group to all cluster nodes.

[[s-heartbeat-crm-drbd-ocf-ra]]
====== Using the `drbd` OCF resource agent in a Heartbeat CRM configuration

The `drbd` resource agent is a "pure-bred" OCF RA which provides
Master/Slave capability, allowing Heartbeat to start and monitor the
DRBD resource on multiple nodes and promoting and demoting as
needed. You must, however, understand that the `drbd` RA disconnects
and detaches all DRBD resources it manages on Heartbeat shutdown, and
also upon enabling standby mode for a node.

In order to enable a DRBD-backed configuration for a MySQL database in
a Heartbeat CRM cluster with the `drbd` OCF resource agent, you must
create both the necessary resources, and Heartbeat constraints to
ensure your service only starts on a previously promoted DRBD
resource. It is recommended that you start with the constraints, such
as shown in this example:

[source,xml]
----
<constraints>
  <rsc_order id="mysql_after_drbd" from="rg_mysql" action="start"
             to="ms_drbd_mysql" to_action="promote" type="after"/>
  <rsc_colocation id="mysql_on_drbd" to="ms_drbd_mysql"
                  to_role="master" from="rg_mysql" score="INFINITY"/>
</constraints>
----

Assuming you put these settings in a file named
`/tmp/constraints.xml`, here is how you would enable them:
----
cibadmin -U -x /tmp/constraints.xml
----

Subsequently, you would create your relevant resources:

[source,xml]
----
<resources>
  <master_slave id="ms_drbd_mysql">
    <meta_attributes id="ms_drbd_mysql-meta_attributes">
      <attributes>

        <nvpair name="globally_unique" value="false"/>
      </attributes>
    </meta_attributes>
    <primitive id="drbd_mysql" class="ocf" provider="heartbeat"
        type="drbd">
      <instance_attributes id="ms_drbd_mysql-instance_attributes">

        <op id="ms_drbd_mysql-monitor-slave"
            name="monitor" interval="30s"

Assuming you put these settings in a file named `/tmp/resources.xml`,
here is how you would enable them:

----
cibadmin -U -x /tmp/resources.xml
----

After this, your configuration should be enabled. Heartbeat now
selects a node on which it promotes the DRBD resource, and then starts
the DRBD-backed resource group on that same node.

[[s-heartbeat-crm-manage]]
==== Managing Heartbeat CRM clusters

[[s-heartbeat-crm-assume-resources]]
===== Assuming control of cluster resources

A Heartbeat CRM cluster node may assume control of cluster resources
in the following ways:

.Manual takeover of a single cluster resource
This is the approach normally taken if one simply wishes to test
resource migration, or move a resource to the local node as a means of
manual load balancing. This operation is performed using the following
command: indexterm:[Heartbeat]indexterm:[crm_resource (Heartbeat
command)]

----
crm_resource -r <resource> -M -H uname -n
----

[[n-heartbeat-crm-migrate]]
NOTE: The `-M` (or `--migrate`) option for the `crm_resource` command,
when used without the `-H` option, implies a resource migration _away_
from the local host. You must initiate a migration _to_ the local host
by specifying the `-H` option, giving the local host name as the
option argument.

It is also important to understand that the migration is _permanent_,
that is, unless told otherwise, Heartbeat will not move the resource
back to a node it was previously migrated away from â€” even if that
node happens to be the only surviving node in a near-cluster-wide
system failure. This is undesirable under most circumstances. So, it
is prudent to immediately "un-migrate" resources after successful
migration, using the following command:
indexterm:[Heartbeat]indexterm:[crm_resource (Heartbeat command)]

----
crm_resource -r <resource> -U
----

Finally, it is important to know that during resource migration,
Heartbeat may simultaneously migrate resources other than the one
explicitly specified (as required by existing resource groups or
colocation and order constraints).

.Manual takeover of all cluster resources
This procedure involves switching the peer node to standby mode (where
_<hostname>_ is the peer node's host name):
indexterm:[Heartbeat]indexterm:[crm_standby (Heartbeat command)]

----
crm_standby -U <hostname> -v on
----


[[s-heartbeat-crm-relinquish-resources]]
===== Relinquishing cluster resources

A Heartbeat CRM cluster node may be forced to give up one or all of
its resources in several ways.

.Giving up a single cluster resource
A node gives up control of a single resource when issued the following
command (note that <<n-heartbeat-crm-migrate,the considerations
outlined in the previous section>>apply here, too):
indexterm:[Heartbeat]indexterm:[crm_resource (Heartbeat command)]

----
crm_resource -r resource -M
----

If you want to migrate to a specific host, use this variant:

----
crm_resource -r resource -M -H hostname
----

However, the latter syntax is usually of little relevance to CRM
clusters using DRBD, DRBD being limited to two nodes (so the two
variants are, essentially, identical in meaning).

.Switching a cluster node to standby mode
This is the approach normally taken if one simply wishes to test
resource migration, or perform some other activity that does not
require the node to leave the cluster. This operation is performed
using the following command:
indexterm:[Heartbeat]indexterm:[crm_standby (Heartbeat command)]

----
crm_standby -U `uname -n` -v on
----

.Shutting down the local cluster manager instance
This approach is suited for local maintenance operations such as
software updates which require that the node be temporarily removed
from the cluster, but which do not necessitate a system reboot. The
procedure is <<fp-heartbeat-r1-shutdown-local-cluster-manager,the same
as for Heartbeat R1 style clusters>>.

.Shutting down the local node
For hardware maintenance or other interventions that require a system
shutdown or reboot, use a simple graceful shutdown command, just as
previously outlined <<fp-heartbeat-r1-shutdown-local-node,for
Heartbeat R1 style clusters>>.


[[s-heartbeat-dopd]]
=== Using Heartbeat with `dopd`

indexterm:[dopd]The steps outlined in this section enable DRBD to deny
services access to <<s-outdate,outdated data>>. The Heartbeat
component that implements this functionality is the _DRBD outdate-peer
daemon_, or `dopd` for short. It works, and uses identical
configuration, on both <<s-heartbeat-r1,R1-compatible>>and
<<s-heartbeat-crm,CRM>> clusters.

IMPORTANT: It is absolutely vital to configure at least two independent
<<s-heartbeat-communication-channels,Heartbeat communication
channels>>for `dopd` to work correctly.



[[s-dopd-heartbeat-config]]
==== Heartbeat configuration

To enable dopd, you must add these lines to your indexterm:[ha.cf
(Heartbeat configuration file)]`/etc/ha.d/ha.cf` file:

[source,drbd]
----
respawn hacluster /usr/lib/heartbeat/dopd
apiauth dopd gid=haclient uid=hacluster
----

You may have to adjust ``dopd``'s path according to your preferred
distribution. On some distributions and architectures, the correct
path is `/usr/lib64/heartbeat/dopd`.

After you have made this change and copied `ha.cf` to the peer node,
you must run `/etc/init.d/heartbeat reload` to have Heartbeat re-read
its configuration file. Afterwards, you should be able to verify that
you now have a running `dopd` process.

NOTE: You can check for this process either by running `ps ax | grep
dopd` or by issuing `killall -0 dopd`.



[[s-dopd-drbd-config]]
==== DRBD Configuration

Then, add these items to your DRBD resource configuration:

[source,drbd]
----
resource <resource> {
    handlers {
        fence-peer "/usr/lib/heartbeat/drbd-peer-outdater -t 5";
        ...
    }
    disk {
        fencing resource-only;
        ...
    }
    ...
}
----

As with `dopd`, your distribution may place the `drbd-peer-outdater`
binary in `/usr/lib64/heartbeat` depending on your system
architecture.

Finally, copy your `drbd.conf` to the peer node and issue `drbdadm
adjust resource` to reconfigure your resource and reflect your
changes.

[[s-dopd-test]]
==== Testing `dopd` functionality

To test whether your `dopd` setup is working correctly, interrupt the
replication link of a configured and connected resource while
Heartbeat services are running normally. You may do so simply by
physically unplugging the network link, but that is fairly
invasive. Instead, you may insert a temporary `iptables` rule to drop
incoming DRBD traffic to the TCP port used by your resource.

After this, you will be able to observe the resource
<<s-connection-states,connection state>> change from
indexterm:[connection state]indexterm:[Connected (connection state)]
_Connected_ to indexterm:[connection state]indexterm:[WFConnection
(connection state)]_WFConnection_. Allow a few seconds to pass, and
you should see the <<s-disk-states,disk state>>become indexterm:[disk
state]indexterm:[Outdated (disk state)]__Outdated__/__DUnknown__. That is
what `dopd` is responsible for.

Any attempt to switch the outdated resource to the primary role will
fail after this.

When re-instituting network connectivity (either by plugging the
physical link or by removing the temporary `iptables` rule you inserted
previously), the connection state will change to _Connected_, and then
promptly to _SyncTarget_ (assuming changes occurred on the primary node
during the network interruption). Then you will be able to observe a
brief synchronization period, and finally, the previously outdated
resource will be marked as indexterm:[disk state]indexterm:[UpToDate
(disk state)]_UpToDate_ again.
