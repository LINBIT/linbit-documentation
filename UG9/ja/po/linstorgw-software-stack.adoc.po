"DRBD Reactor – again, as the name implies – _reacts_ to DRBD events.  DRBD "
"already comes with sophisticated state management mechanisms to ensure that "
"only one node in the cluster has write access to a resource at a time.  In "
"the promoter plugin, we use this to our advantage to make sure that a "
"particular service is always started on the same node that is allowed to "
"write to the resource."
