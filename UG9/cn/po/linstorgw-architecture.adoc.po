"*Only one LINSTOR Gateway server*: This is the simplest setup. If the LINSTOR controller software always runs on the same node, it makes sense to place the LINSTOR Gateway server on that same node. +\n"
"The advantage of this approach is that the LINSTOR Gateway server will need no further configuration to find the LINSTOR controller. +\n"
"The disadvantage is that you will need to configure your LINSTOR Gateway client so that it finds the LINSTOR Gateway server.\n"

msgid "*Multiple LINSTOR Gateway servers*: If your LINSTOR controller can move between nodes (for example, because you made it highly available by using DRBD Reactor), it can be beneficial to run a LINSTOR Gateway server on every node where the LINSTOR Controller could potentially run.\n"
