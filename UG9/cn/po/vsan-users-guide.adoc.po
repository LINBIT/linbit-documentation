"In practice, VSAN runs one of its instances as a virtual machine on each "
"hypervisor in the cluster.  The hypervisor passes its local storage through "
"to VSAN, which then replicates the storage's data across the cluster.  One "
"of the VSAN virtual machines exports an iSCSI target through a static IP.  "
"This iSCSI target can be fed back to the hypervisor in order to provide a "
"highly available datastore.  The resulting datastore can be used to store "
"virtual machines and disk images on solid, redundant storage."
