== Integrating DRBD with Red Hat Cluster

indexterm:[Red Hat Cluster]This chapter describes using DRBD as
replicated storage for Red Hat Cluster high availability
clusters.

NOTE: This guide uses the unofficial term _Red Hat Cluster_ to refer
to a product that has had multiple official product names over its
history, including _Red Hat Cluster Suite_ and _Red Hat Enterprise
Linux High Availability Add-On_.

=== Red Hat Cluster Background Information

[[s-rhcs-fencing]]
==== Fencing

Red Hat Cluster, originally designed primarily for shared
storage clusters, relies on node fencing to prevent concurrent,
uncoordinated access to shared resources. The Red Hat Cluster
fencing infrastructure relies on the fencing daemon `fenced`, and
fencing agents implemented as shell scripts.

Even though DRBD-based clusters utilize no shared storage resources
and thus fencing is not strictly required from DRBD's standpoint, Red
Hat Cluster Suite still requires fencing even in DRBD-based
configurations.

[[s-rhcs-rgmanager]]
==== The Resource Group Manager

The resource group manager (`rgmanager`, alternatively `clurgmgr`) is
akin to Pacemaker. It serves as the cluster management suite's primary
interface with the applications it is configured to manage.

[[s-rhcs-resources]]
===== Red Hat Cluster Resources

indexterm:[Red Hat Cluster]A single highly available
application, filesystem, IP address and the like is referred to as a
_resource_ in Red Hat Cluster terminology.

Where resources depend on each other -- such as, for example, an NFS
export depending on a filesystem being mounted -- they form a
_resource tree_, a form of nesting resources inside another. Resources
in inner levels of nesting may inherit parameters from resources in
outer nesting levels. The concept of resource trees is absent in
Pacemaker.

[[s-rhcs-services]]
===== Red Hat Cluster Services

indexterm:[Red Hat Cluster]Where resources form a co-dependent
collection, that collection is called a _service_. This is different
from Pacemaker, where such a collection is referred to as a _resource
group_.

[[s-rhcs-resource-agents]]
===== RGManager Resource Agents

The resource agents invoked by `rgmanager` are similar to those used by
Pacemaker, in the sense that they utilize the same shell-based
API as defined in the Open Cluster Framework (OCF), although Pacemaker
utilizes some extensions not defined in the framework. Thus in theory,
the resource agents are largely interchangeable between Red Hat
Cluster Suite and Pacemaker -- in practice however, the two cluster
management suites use different resource agents even for similar or
identical tasks.

Red Hat Cluster resource agents install into the `/usr/share/cluster/`
directory. Unlike Pacemaker OCF resource agents which are by
convention self-contained, some Red Hat Cluster resource agents are
split into a `.sh` file containing the actual shell code, and a
`.metadata` file containing XML resource agent metadata.

DRBD includes a Red Hat Cluster resource agent. It installs into the
customary directory as `drbd.sh` and `drbd.metadata`.

[[s-rhcs-config]]
=== Configuring a Red Hat Cluster

This section outlines the configuration steps necessary to get Red Hat
Cluster running. Preparing your cluster configuration is fairly
straightforward; all a DRBD-based Red Hat Cluster requires are two
participating nodes (referred to as _Cluster Members_ in Red Hat's
documentation) and a fencing device.

NOTE: For more information about configuring Red Hat clusters, see
http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/csgfs/[Red Hat's documentation on
the Red Hat Cluster and GFS.]


[[s-rhcs-cluster-conf]]
==== The Cluster Configuration File

RHEL clusters keep their configuration in a single configuration file,
indexterm:[Red Hat Cluster]indexterm:[cluster.conf (Red Hat Cluster
configuration file)]`/etc/cluster/cluster.conf`. You may manage your
cluster configuration in the following ways:

.Editing the configuration file directly
This is the most straightforward method. It has no prerequisites other
than having a text editor available.

.Using the `system-config-cluster` GUI
This is a GUI application written in Python using Glade. It requires
the availability of an X display (either directly on a server console,
or tunneled via SSH).

.Using the Conga web-based management infrastructure
The Conga infrastructure consists of a node agent ( `ricci`)
communicating with the local cluster manager, cluster resource
manager, and cluster LVM daemon, and an administration web application
( `luci`) which may be used to configure the cluster infrastructure
using a simple web browser.


[[s-rhcs-failover-clusters]]
=== Using DRBD in Red Hat Cluster Failover Clusters

NOTE: This section deals exclusively with setting up DRBD for Red Hat
Cluster failover clusters not involving GFS. For GFS (and GFS2)
configurations, please see <<ch-gfs>>.

This section, like <<ch-pacemaker>>, assumes you are about to
configure a highly available MySQL database with the following
configuration parameters:

* The DRBD resources to be used as your database storage area is named
  `mysql`, and it manages the device `/dev/drbd0`.

* The DRBD device holds an ext3 filesystem which is to be mounted to
  `/var/lib/mysql` (the default MySQL data directory).

* The MySQL database is to utilize that filesystem, and listen on a
  dedicated cluster IP address, 192.168.42.1.

[[s-rhcs-example-cluster-conf]]
==== Setting up Your Cluster Configuration

To configure your highly available MySQL database, create or modify
your `/etc/cluster/cluster.conf` file to contain the following
configuration items.

To do that, open `/etc/cluster/cluster.conf` with your preferred text
editing application. Then, include the following items in your
resource configuration:

[source,xml]
----------------------------
<rm>
  <resources />
  <service autostart="1" name="mysql">
    <drbd name="drbd-mysql" resource="mysql">
      <fs device="/dev/drbd/by-res/mysql/0"
          mountpoint="/var/lib/mysql"
          fstype="ext3"
          name="mysql"
          options="noatime"/>
    </drbd>
    <ip address="192.168.42.1" monitor_link="1"/>
    <mysql config_file="/etc/my.cnf"
           listen_address="192.168.42.1"
           name="mysqld"/>
  </service>
</rm>
----------------------------

NOTE: This example assumes a single-volume resource.

Nesting resource references inside one another in `<service/>` is the
Red Hat Cluster way of expressing resource dependencies.

Be sure to increment the `config_version` attribute, found on the root
`<cluster>` element, after you have completed your
configuration. Then, issue the following commands to commit your
changes to the running cluster configuration:

----------------------------
# ccs_tool update /etc/cluster/cluster.conf
# cman_tool version -r <version>
----------------------------

In the second command, be sure to replace _<version>_ with the new
cluster configuration version number.

NOTE: Both the `system-config-cluster` GUI configuration utility and
the Conga web based cluster management infrastructure will complain
about your cluster configuration after including the `drbd` resource
agent in your `cluster.conf` file. This is due to the design of the
Python cluster management wrappers provided by these two applications
which does not expect third party extensions to the cluster
infrastructure.

Thus, when you utilize the `drbd` resource agent in cluster
configurations, it is not recommended to utilize
`system-config-cluster` nor Conga for cluster configuration
purposes. Using either of these tools to only monitor the cluster's
status, however, is expected to work fine.
