== DRBD Volumes in Proxmox VE

indexterm:[Proxmox]This chapter describes DRBD in Proxmox VE via
the http://git.linbit.com/linstor-proxmox.git[LINSTOR Proxmox Plugin].

[[s-proxmox-ls-overview]]
=== Proxmox VE Overview

http://www.proxmox.com/en/[Proxmox VE] is an easy to use, complete server
virtualization environment with KVM, Linux Containers and HA.

'linstor-proxmox' is a Perl plugin for Proxmox that, in combination with LINSTOR, allows to replicate VM
//(LVM volumes on DRBD)
disks  on several Proxmox VE nodes. This allows to live-migrate
active VMs within a few seconds and with no downtime without needing a central SAN, as the data is already
replicated to multiple nodes.

[[s-proxmox-ls-install]]
=== Proxmox Plugin Installation

LINBIT provides a dedicated public repository for Proxmox VE users. This repository not only contains the
Proxmox plugin, but the whole DRBD SDS stack including a DRBD SDS kernel
module and user space utilities.

The DRBD9 kernel module is installed as a `dkms` package (i.e., `drbd-dkms`), therefore you'll have to install
`pve-headers` package, before you set up/install the software packages from LINBIT's repositories. Following that order, ensures that
the kernel module will build properly for your kernel. If you don't plan to install the latest Proxmox kernel, you have to
install kernel headers matching your current running kernel (e.g., `pve-headers-$(uname -r)`). If you missed this step, then still you can rebuild the dkms package against your current kernel, (kernel headers have to be
installed in advance), by issuing `apt-get install --reinstall drbd-dkms` command.

LINBIT's repository can be enabled as follows, where "$PVERS" should be set to your Proxmox VE *major version*
(e.g., "5", not "5.2"):

----------------------------
# wget -O- https://packages.linbit.com/package-signing-pubkey.asc | apt-key add -
# PVERS=5 && echo "deb http://packages.linbit.com/proxmox/ proxmox-$PVERS drbd-9.0" > \
	/etc/apt/sources.list.d/linbit.list
# apt-get update && apt-get install linstor-proxmox
----------------------------

[[s-proxmox-ls-ls-configuration]]
=== LINSTOR Configuration
For the following we assume that you have a LINSTOR cluster configured as described in
<<s-linstor-init-cluster>>. In the most simple case have one storage pool definition (e.g., "drbdpool") and the
equivalent storage pools on every PVE node. If you have multiple pools, currently the plugin selects one of
these, but as of now you can not control which one. But usually you only have one pool for you DRBD resources
anyways. Also make sure to create every node as a "Combined" node. Start the "linstor-controller" on one
node, and the "linstor-satellite" on all nodes.

[[s-proxmox-ls-configuration]]
=== Proxmox Plugin Configuration
The final step is to provide a configuration for Proxmox itself. This can be done by adding an entry in the
`/etc/pve/storage.cfg` file, with the following content, assuming a three node cluster in this example:

----------------------------
drbd: drbdstorage
   content images,rootdir
   redundancy 3
   controller 10.11.12.13
----------------------------

The "drbd" entry is fixed and you are not allowed to modify it, as it tells to Proxmox to use DRBD as storage backend.
The "drbdstorage" entry can be modified and is used as a friendly name that will be shown in the PVE web GUI to locate the DRBD storage. 
The "content" entry is also fixed, so do not change it. The "redundancy" parameter specifies how many replicas of the data will be stored
in the cluster.The recommended is to set it to "3", assuming that you have a three node cluster as a minimum.
The data is accessible from all nodes, even if some of them do not have local copies of the data. 
For example, in a 5 node cluster, all nodes will be able to access 3 copies of the data, no matter where they are stored in. The "controller"
parameter must be set to the IP of the node that runs the LINSTOR controller service. Only one node can be set to run as LINSTOR controller at the same time.
If that node fails, start the LINSTOR controller on another node and change that value to its IP address. There are more elegant ways to deal with this problem.For more, see later in this chapter how to setup a highly available LINSTOR controller VM in Proxmox.

By now, you should be able to create VMs via Proxmox's web GUI by selecting "__drbdstorage__" as storage location.

.NOTE: DRBD supports only the **raw** disk format at the moment.

At this point you can try to live migrate the VM - as all data is accessible on all nodes (even on Diskless nodes) - it will take just a
few seconds. The overall process might take a bit longer if the VM is under load and if there is a lot of RAM being dirtied all the time. 
But in any case, the downtime should be minimal and you will see no interruption at all.

[[s-proxmox-ls-HA]]
=== Making the Controller Highly-Available
For the described HA setup we assume that you installed LINSTOR and the Proxmox Plugin as described in
<<s-proxmox-ls-ls-configuration>>.

The basic idea is to execute the LINSTOR controller within a VM that is controlled by Proxmox and its HA
features, where the storage resides on DRBD managed by LINSTOR itself.

The first step is to allocate storage for the VM: Create a VM as usual and select "Do not use any media" on
the "OS" section. The hard disk should of course reside on DRBD (e.g., "drbdstorage"). 2GB disk space should
be enough, and for RAM we chose 1GB. These are the minimal requirements for the appliance LINBIT provides to
its customers (see below). If you set up your own controller VM, or resources are not constrained, increase
these minimal values. In the following we assume that the controller VM was created with ID 100, but it is
fine if this VM is created later, after you already created other VMs.

LINBIT provides an appliance for its customers that can be used to populate the created storage. For the
appliance to work, we first create a "Serial Port". First click on "Hardware" and then on "Add" and finally on
"Serial Port":

[[img-pm_add_serial1_controller_vm.png]]
.Adding a Serial Port
image::images/pm_add_serial1_controller_vm.png[]

If everything worked as expected the VM definition should then look like this:

[[img-pm_add_serial2_controller_vm.png]]
.VM with Serial Port
image::images/pm_add_serial2_controller_vm.png[]

The next step is to copy the VM appliance to the created storage. This can be done with `qemu-img`.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to replace the VM ID with the correct one.

------------------
# qemu-img dd -O raw if=/tmp/linbit-linstor-controller-amd64.img \
  of=/dev/drbd/by-res/vm-100-disk-1/0
------------------

After that you can start the VM and connect to it via the Proxmox VNC viewer. The default user name and
password are both "linbit". Note that we kept the defaults for ssh, so you will not be able to log in to the VM
via ssh and username/password. If you want to enable that (and/or "root" login), enable these settings in
`/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and restart the ssh service. As this VM is based on "Ubuntu Bionic", you should change
your network settings (e.g., static IP) in `/etc/netplan/config.yaml`. After that you should be able to ssh to
the VM:

[[img-pm_ssh_controller_vm.png]]
.LINBIT LINSTOR Controller Appliance
image::images/pm_ssh_controller_vm.png[]

In the next step you add the controller VM to the existing cluster:

------------
# linstor node create --node-type Controller \
  linstor-controller 10.43.7.254
------------

As this special VM will be not be managed by the Proxmox Plugin, make sure all hosts have access to that VM's
storage.
In our test cluster we checked via `linstor resource list` where the storage was already deployed and created
further assignments via `linstor resource create`. In our lab consisting of four nodes, we made all resource
assignments diskful, but diskless assignments are fine as well. As a rule of thumb keep the redundancy count
at "3" (more usually does not make sense), and assign the rest diskless.

As the storage for this particular VM has to be made available (i.e., `drbdadm up`) somehow, enable the
`drbd.service` on all nodes:

--------------
# systemctl enable drbd
# systemctl start drbd
--------------

After that it is time for the final steps, namely switching from the existing controller to the new one in the
VM. So let's stop the old controller service on the old host, and copy the LINSTOR controller database to the
VM:

-----------
# systemctl stop linstor-controller
# systemctl disable linstor-controller
# scp /var/lib/linstor/* root@10.43.7.254:/var/lib/linstor/
-----------

Finally, we can enable the controller in the VM:

-----------
# systemctl start linstor-controller # in the VM
# systemctl enable linstor-controller # in the VM
-----------

To check if everything worked as expected, you can query the cluster nodes on a host by asking the controller
in the VM: `linstor --controllers=10.43.7.254 node list`. It is perfectly fine that the controller (which is
just a controller and not "combined") is shown as "OFFLINE". Still, this might change in the future to
something more appropriate.

As the last -- but crucial -- step, you need to add the "controlervm" option to
`/etc/pve/storage.cfg`, and change the controller IP:

----------------------------
drbd: drbdstorage
   content images,rootdir
   redundancy 3
   controller 10.43.7.254
   controllervm 100
----------------------------

By setting the "controllervm" parameter the plugin will ignore (or act accordingly) if there are actions on
the controller VM. Basically, this VM should not be managed by the plugin, so the plugin mainly ignores all
actions on the given controller VM ID. Unfortunately there is one exception: When you delete the VM in the GUI,
it is gone from the GUI. We did not find a way to return/die in a way that would not delete the VM from the
GUI. However, such requests are ignored by the plugin, so the VM will not be deleted from the LINSTOR cluster.
Therefore, it is possible to later create a VM with the ID of the old controller. The plugin will just return
"OK", and the old VM with the old data can be used again. All in all, make your life easier, and be careful to
not delete the controller VM.

Currently, we have the controller executed as VM, but we should make sure that one instance of the VM is
started at all times. For that we use Proxmox's HA feature. Click on the VM, then on "More", and then on
"Manage HA". We set the following parameters for our controller VM:

[[img-pm_manage_ha_controller_vm.png]]
.HA settings for the controller VM
image::images/pm_manage_ha_controller_vm.png[]

As long as there are surviving nodes in your Proxmox cluster, everything should be fine and in case the node
hosting the controller VM is shut down or lost, Proxmox HA will make sure the controller is started on another
host. Obviously the IP of the controller VM should not change. It is up to you as admin to make sure this is
the case (e.g., setting a static IP, or always providing the same IP via dhcp on the bridged interface).

One limitation that is not fully handled with this setup is a total cluster outage (e.g., common power supply
failure) with a restart of all cluster nodes. Proxmox is unfortunately pretty limited in that regard. You can
enable the "HA Feature" for a VM, and you can define "Start and Shutdown Order" constraints. But both are
completely separated from each other. Therefore it is hard/impossible to make sure that the controller VM is
up and then all other VMs are started.

It might be possible to work around that by delaying VM startup in the Proxmox plugin itself until the
controller VM is up (i.e., if the plugin is asked to start the controller VM it does it, otherwise it waits
and pings the controller). While a nice idea, this would horribly fail in a serialized, non-concurrent VM
start/plugin call event stream where some VM should be started (which then blocks) before the controller VM is
scheduled to be started. That would obviously result in a deadlock.

We will discuss options with Proxmox, but we think the presented solution is valuable in typical use cases as
is, especially compared to the complexity of a pacemaker setup. Use cases where one can expect that not the
whole cluster goes down at the same time are covered. And even if that is the case, only automatic startup of
the VMs would not work when the whole cluster is started. In such a scenario the admin just has to wait until
the Proxmox HA service starts the controller VM.  After that all VMs can be started manually/scripted on the
command line.
