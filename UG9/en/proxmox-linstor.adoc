== DRBD Volumes in Proxmox VE

indexterm:[Proxmox]This chapter describes DRBD in Proxmox VE via
the http://git.linbit.com/linstor-proxmox.git[LINSTOR Proxmox Plugin].

[[s-proxmox-ls-overview]]
=== Proxmox VE Overview

http://www.proxmox.com/en/[Proxmox VE] is an easy to use, complete server
virtualization environment with KVM, Linux Containers and HA.

'linstor-proxmox' is a Perl plugin for Proxmox that, in combination with LINSTOR, allows to replicate VM
//(LVM volumes on DRBD)
disks  on several Proxmox VE nodes. This allows to live-migrate
active VMs within a few seconds and with no downtime without needing a central SAN, as the data is already
replicated to multiple nodes.

[[s-proxmox-ls-install]]
=== Proxmox Plugin Installation

LINBIT provides a dedicated public repository for Proxmox VE users. This repository not only contains the
Proxmox plugin, but the whole DRBD SDS stack including a DRBD SDS kernel
module and user space utilities.

The DRBD9 kernel module is installed as a `dkms` package (i.e., `drbd-dkms`), therefore you'll have to install
`pve-headers` package, before you set up/install the software packages from LINBIT's repositories. Following
that order, ensures that the kernel module will build properly for your kernel. If you don't plan to install
the latest Proxmox kernel, you have to install kernel headers matching your current running kernel (e.g.,
		`pve-headers-$(uname -r)`). If you missed this step, then still you can rebuild the dkms package against
your current kernel, (kernel headers have to be installed in advance), by issuing `apt-get install --reinstall
drbd-dkms` command.

LINBIT's repository can be enabled as follows, where "$PVERS" should be set to your Proxmox VE *major version*
(e.g., "5", not "5.2"):

----------------------------
# wget -O- https://packages.linbit.com/package-signing-pubkey.asc | apt-key add -
# PVERS=5 && echo "deb http://packages.linbit.com/proxmox/ proxmox-$PVERS drbd-9.0" > \
	/etc/apt/sources.list.d/linbit.list
# apt-get update && apt-get install linstor-proxmox
----------------------------

[[s-proxmox-ls-ls-configuration]]
=== LINSTOR Configuration
For the  rest of this guide we assume that you have a LINSTOR cluster configured as described in
<<s-linstor-init-cluster>>. In the most simple case you will have one storage pool definition (e.g.,
		"drbdpool") and the equivalent storage pools on each PVE node. If you have multiple pools, currently the
plugin selects one of those, but as of now you can not control which one. But usually you have only one pool
for your DRBD resources, so that shouldn't be a problem. Also make sure to setup each node as a "Combined"
node. Start the "linstor-controller" on one node, and the "linstor-satellite" on all nodes.

[[s-proxmox-ls-configuration]]
=== Proxmox Plugin Configuration
The final step is to provide a configuration for Proxmox itself. This can be done by adding an entry in the
`/etc/pve/storage.cfg` file, with the following content, assuming a three node cluster in this example:

----------------------------
drbd: drbdstorage
   content images,rootdir
   redundancy 3
   controller 10.11.12.13
----------------------------

The "drbd" entry is fixed and you are not allowed to modify it, as it tells to Proxmox to use DRBD as storage
backend.  The "drbdstorage" entry can be modified and is used as a friendly name that will be shown in the PVE
web GUI to locate the DRBD storage.  The "content" entry is also fixed, so do not change it. The "redundancy"
parameter specifies how many replicas of the data will be stored in the cluster.The recommended is to set it
to "3", assuming that you have a three node cluster as a minimum.  The data is accessible from all nodes, even
if some of them do not have local copies of the data.  For example, in a 5 node cluster, all nodes will be
able to access 3 copies of the data, no matter where they are stored in. The "controller" parameter must be
set to the IP of the node that runs the LINSTOR controller service. Only one node can be set to run as LINSTOR
controller at the same time.  If that node fails, start the LINSTOR controller on another node and change that
value to its IP address. There are more elegant ways to deal with this problem.For more, see later in this
chapter how to setup a highly available LINSTOR controller VM in Proxmox.

By now, you should be able to create VMs via Proxmox's web GUI by selecting "__drbdstorage__" as storage location.

.NOTE: DRBD supports only the **raw** disk format at the moment.

At this point you can try to live migrate the VM - as all data is accessible on all nodes (even on Diskless
nodes) - it will take just a few seconds. The overall process might take a bit longer if the VM is under
load and if there is a lot of RAM being dirtied all the time.  But in any case, the downtime should be minimal
and you will see no interruption at all.

[[s-proxmox-ls-HA]]
=== Making the Controller Highly-Available
For the rest of this guide we assume that you installed LINSTOR and the Proxmox Plugin as described in
<<s-proxmox-ls-ls-configuration>>.

The basic idea is to execute the LINSTOR controller within a VM that is controlled by Proxmox and its HA
features, where the storage resides on DRBD managed by LINSTOR itself.

The first step is to allocate storage for the VM: Create a VM as usual and select "Do not use any media" on
the "OS" section. The hard disk should of course reside on DRBD (e.g., "drbdstorage"). 2GB disk space should
be enough, and for RAM we chose 1GB. These are the minimum requirements for the appliance LINBIT provides to
its customers (see below). If you wish to set up your own controller VM, and you have enough hardware
resources available, you can increase these minimum values. In the following use case, we assume that the
controller VM was created with ID 100, but it is fine if this VM was created at a later time and has a
different ID.

LINBIT provides an appliance for its customers that can be used to populate the created storage. For the
appliance to work, we first create a "Serial Port". First click on "Hardware" and then on "Add" and finally on
"Serial Port":

[[img-pm_add_serial1_controller_vm.png]]
.Adding a Serial Port
image::images/pm_add_serial1_controller_vm.png[]

If everything worked as expected the VM definition should then look like this:

[[img-pm_add_serial2_controller_vm.png]]
.VM with Serial Port
image::images/pm_add_serial2_controller_vm.png[]

The next step is to copy the VM appliance to the VM disk storage. This can be done with `qemu-img`.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to replace the VM ID with the correct one.

------------------
# qemu-img dd -O raw if=/tmp/linbit-linstor-controller-amd64.img \
  of=/dev/drbd/by-res/vm-100-disk-1/0
------------------

Once completed you can start the VM and connect to it via the Proxmox VNC viewer. The default user name and
password are both "linbit". Note that we kept the default configuration for the ssh server, so you will not be
able to log in to the VM via ssh and username/password. If you want to enable that (and/or "root" login),
enable these settings in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and restart the ssh service. As this VM is based on "Ubuntu
Bionic", you should change your network settings (e.g., static IP) in `/etc/netplan/config.yaml`.  After that
you should be able to ssh to the VM:

[[img-pm_ssh_controller_vm.png]]
.LINBIT LINSTOR Controller Appliance
image::images/pm_ssh_controller_vm.png[]

In the next step you add the controller VM to the existing cluster:

------------
# linstor node create --node-type Controller \
  linstor-controller 10.43.7.254
------------

IMPORTANT: As the Controller VM will be handled in a special way by the Proxmox storage plugin (comparing to
the rest of VMs), we must make sure all hosts have access to its backing storage, *before* PVE HA starts
the VM, otherwise the VM will fail to start. See below for the details on how to achieve this.

In our test cluster the Controller VM disk was created in DRBD storage and it was initially assigned to one
host (use `linstor resource list` to check the assignments).  Then, we used `linstor resource create` command
to create additional resource assignments to the other nodes of the cluster for this VM.  In our lab
consisting of four nodes, we created all resource assignments as diskful, but diskless assignments are fine as
well. As a rule of thumb keep the redundancy count at "3" (more usually does not make sense), and assign the
rest as diskless.

As the storage for the Controller VM must be made available on all PVE hosts in some way, we must make sure to
enable the `drbd.service` on all hosts (given that it is not controlled by LINSTOR at this stage):

--------------
# systemctl enable drbd
# systemctl start drbd
--------------

At startup, the `linstor-satellite` service deletes all of its resource files (`*.res`) and regenerates them.
This conflicts with the `drbd` services that needs these resource files to start the controller VM. Recent LINSTOR
releases support a `-k/--keep-res` parameter where one can specify a regular expression. Resource files
matching this expression are not deleted. To make the necessary changes, you need to edit the service file
via systemctl (do *not* edit the file directly).

--------------
systemctl edit linstor-satellite
# Change the "ExecStart" line to include: --keep-res=vm-100
# "vm-100", if 100 is your VM ID is good enough, remember, it is a regular expression
# You need to include "[Service]" and you need to reset the old value
# The file should look like that:
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/share/linstor-server/bin/Satellite --logs=/var/log/linstor-satellite --config-directory=/etc/linstor --keep-res=vm-100
--------------

Don't forget to restart the `linstor-satellite.service`.

After that, it is time for the final steps, namely switching from the existing controller (residing on the
physical host) to the new one in the VM. So let's stop the old controller service on the physical host, and
copy the LINSTOR controller database to the VM host:

-----------
# systemctl stop linstor-controller
# systemctl disable linstor-controller
# scp /var/lib/linstor/* root@10.43.7.254:/var/lib/linstor/
-----------

Finally, we can enable the controller in the VM:

-----------
# systemctl start linstor-controller # in the VM
# systemctl enable linstor-controller # in the VM
-----------

To check if everything worked as expected, you can query the cluster nodes on a physical PVE host by asking
the controller in the VM: `linstor --controllers=10.43.7.254 node list`. It is perfectly fine that the
controller (which is just a Controller and not a "Combined" host) is shown as "OFFLINE". This might change in
the future to something more reasonable.

As the last -- but crucial -- step, you need to add the "controlervm" option to
`/etc/pve/storage.cfg`, and change the controller IP address to the IP address of the Controller VM:

----------------------------
drbd: drbdstorage
   content images,rootdir
   redundancy 3
   controller 10.43.7.254
   controllervm 100
----------------------------

Please note the additional setting "controllervm". This setting is very important, as it tells to PVE to
handle the Controller VM differently than the rest of VMs stored in the DRBD storage.  In specific, it will
instruct PVE to NOT use LINSTOR storage plugin for handling the Controller VM, but to use other methods
instead. The reason for this, is that simply LINSTOR backend is not available at this stage.  Once the
Controller VM is up and running (and the associated LINSTOR controller service inside the VM), then the PVE
hosts will be able to start the rest of virtual machines which are stored in the DRBD storage by using LINSTOR
storage plugin. Please make sure to set the correct VM ID in the "controllervm" setting. In this case is set
to "100", which represents the ID assigned to our Controller VM.

It is very important to make sure that the Controller VM is up and running at all times and that you are
backing it up at regular times(mostly when you do modifications to the LINSTOR cluster). Once the VM is gone,
and there are no backups, the LINSTOR cluster must be recreated from scratch.

We haven't found a way to prevent accidental deletion of the VM, so when you delete the VM in the PVE GUI, it
will disappear from the list of VMs.  However, such requests are ignored by our storage plugin, so the VM disk
will NOT be deleted from the LINSTOR cluster.  Therefore, it is possible to recreate the VM with the same ID
as before(simply recreate the VM configuration file in PVE and assign the same DRBD storage device used by the
old VM). The plugin will just return "OK", and the old VM with the old data can be used again. In general, be
careful to not delete the controller VM and "protect" it accordingly.


Currently, we have the controller executed as VM, but we should make sure that one instance of the VM is
started at all times. For that we use Proxmox's HA feature. Click on the VM, then on "More", and then on
"Manage HA". We set the following parameters for our controller VM:

[[img-pm_manage_ha_controller_vm.png]]
.HA settings for the controller VM
image::images/pm_manage_ha_controller_vm.png[]

As long as there are surviving nodes in your Proxmox cluster, everything should be fine and in case the node
hosting the Controller VM is shut down or lost, Proxmox HA will make sure the controller is started on another
host. Obviously the IP of the controller VM should not change. It is up to you as an administrator to make sure this is
the case (e.g., setting a static IP, or always providing the same IP via dhcp on the bridged interface).

It is important to mention at this point that in the case that you are using a dedicated network for the
LINSTOR cluster, you must make sure that the network interfaces  configured for the cluster traffic, are
configured as bridges (i.e vmb1,vmbr2 etc) on the PVE hosts. If they are setup as direct interfaces (i.e
eth0,eth1 etc), then you will not be able to setup the Controller VM vNIC to communicate with the rest of
LINSTOR nodes in the cluster, as you cannot assign direct network interfaces to the VM, but only bridged
interfaces.

One limitation that is not fully handled with this setup is a total cluster outage (e.g., common power supply
failure) with a restart of all cluster nodes. Proxmox is unfortunately pretty limited in this regard. You can
enable the "HA Feature" for a VM, and you can define "Start and Shutdown Order" constraints. But both are
completely separated from each other. Therefore it is hard/impossible to guarantee that the Controller VM will
be up and running, before all other VMs are started.

It might be possible to work around that by delaying VM startup in the Proxmox plugin itself until the
controller VM is up (i.e., if the plugin is asked to start the controller VM it does it, otherwise it waits
and pings the controller). While a nice idea, this would horribly fail in a serialized, non-concurrent VM
start/plugin call event stream where some VM should be started (which then are blocked) before the Controller VM is
scheduled to be started. That would obviously result in a deadlock.

We will discuss these options with Proxmox, but we think the current solution is valuable in most typical use
cases, as is. Especially, compared to the complexity of a pacemaker setup. Use cases where one can expect that
not the whole cluster goes down at the same time are covered. And even if that is the case, only automatic
startup of the VMs would not work when the whole cluster is started. In such a scenario the admin just has to
wait until the Proxmox HA service starts the controller VM.  After that all VMs can be started
manually/scripted on the command line.
