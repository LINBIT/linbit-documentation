[[s-administrative-tasks-setup]]
== Basic Administrative Tasks and System Setup

This is a how-to style chapter that covers basic LINSTOR(R) administrative tasks, including
installing LINSTOR and how to get started using LINSTOR.

[[s-linstor-before-installing]]
=== Before Installing LINSTOR

Before you install LINSTOR, there are a few things that you should be aware of that might affect
how you install LINSTOR.

[[s-packages]]
==== Packages

LINSTOR is packaged in both the RPM and the DEB variants:

. `linstor-client` contains the command line client program. It depends
  on Python which is usually already installed. In RHEL 8 systems you will need to symlink
`python`.
. `linstor-controller`  and `linstor-satellite` Both contain systemd unit files
for the services. They depend on Java runtime environment (JRE) version 1.8
(headless) or higher.

For further details about these packages see the
<<Installable Components,Installable Components>> section above.

NOTE: If you have a LINBIT(R) support subscription, you will have access to
certified binaries through LINBIT customer-only repositories.

[[s-linstor-fips-compliance]]
==== FIPS Compliance

"This standard shall be used in designing and implementing cryptographic modules..."
-- https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/3/final[NIST's _FIPS 140-3_ publication]

You can configure LINSTOR to encrypt storage volumes, by using LUKS (`dm-crypt`), as detailed in
the <<s-linstor-encrypted-volumes, Encrypted Volumes>> section of this user's guide. Refer to
the LUKS and `dm-crypt` projects for FIPS compliance status.

You can also configure LINSTOR to encrypt communication traffic between a LINSTOR satellite and
a LINSTOR controller, by using SSL/TLS, as detailed in the <<s-linstor-secure-connections,
Secure Satellite Connections>> section of this user's guide.

LINSTOR can also interface with Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) and you can use LINSTOR to
initialize an SED drive. LINSTOR stores the drive's password as a property that applies to the
storage pool associated with the drive. LINSTOR encrypts the SED drive password by using the
<<s-encrypt_commands, LINSTOR master passphrase>> that you must create first.

By default, LINSTOR uses the following cryptographic algorithms:

- HMAC-SHA2-512
- PBKDF2
- AES-128

A FIPS compliant version of LINSTOR is available for the use cases mentioned in this section. If
you or your organization require FIPS compliance at this level, contact sales@linbit.com
for details.

[[s-installation]]
=== Installing LINSTOR

IMPORTANT: If you want to use LINSTOR in containers, skip this section and use the
<<s-containers,Containers>> section below for the installation.

==== Installing a Volume Manager

To use LINSTOR to create storage volumes, you will need to install a volume manager, either LVM
or ZFS, if one is not already installed on your system.

ifndef::de-brand[]
[[s-linbit-manage-nodes-script]]
==== Using a Script to Manage LINBIT Cluster Nodes

If you are a LINBIT(R) customer, you can download a LINBIT created helper script and run it on
your nodes to:

* Register a cluster node with LINBIT.
* Join a node to an existing LINBIT cluster.
* Enable LINBIT package repositories on your node.

Enabling LINBIT package repositories will give you access to LINBIT software packages, DRBD(R)
kernel modules, and other related software such as cluster managers and OCF scripts. You can
then use a package manager to fetch, install, and manage updating installed packages.

===== Downloading the LINBIT Manage Node Script

To register your cluster nodes with LINBIT, and configure LINBIT's repositories, first download
and then run the manage node helper script by entering the following commands on all cluster
nodes:

----
# curl -O https://my.linbit.com/linbit-manage-node.py
# chmod +x ./linbit-manage-node.py
# ./linbit-manage-node.py
----

IMPORTANT: You must run the script as the `root` user.

The script will prompt you for your https://my.linbit.com/[LINBIT customer portal] username and
password. After entering your credentials, the script will list cluster nodes associated with
your account (none at first).

[[s-linbit-package-repos-enabling]]
===== Enabling LINBIT Package Repositories

After you specify which cluster to register the node with, have the script write the
registration data to a JSON file when prompted. Next, the script will show you a list of LINBIT
repositories that you can enable or disable. You can find LINSTOR and other related packages
in the `drbd-9` repository. In most cases, unless you have a need to be on a different DRBD
version branch, you should enable at least this repository.

[[s-linbit-manage-nodes-script-final-tasks]]
===== Final Tasks Within Manage Nodes Script

After you have finished making your repositories selection, you can write the configuration to a
file by following the script's prompting. Next, be sure to answer yes to the question about
installing LINBIT's public signing key to your node's keyring.

Before it closes, the script will show a message that suggests different packages that you can
install for different use cases.

IMPORTANT: On DEB based systems you can install a precompiled DRBD kernel module package,
`drbd-module-$(uname -r)`, or a source version of the kernel module, `drbd-dkms`. Install one
or the other package but not both.

[[s-linstor-installing-using-package-manager]]
==== Using a Package Manager to Install LINSTOR

After registering your node and enabling the `drbd-9` LINBIT package repository, you can use a
DEB, RPM, or YaST2 based package manager to install LINSTOR and related components.

IMPORTANT: If you are using a DEB based package manager, refresh your package repositories list
by entering: `apt update`, before proceeding.

[[s-installing-drbd-packages]]
===== Installing DRBD Packages for Replicated LINSTOR Storage

TIP: If you will be <<linstor-administration.adoc#s-linstor-without-drbd,using LINSTOR without
DRBD>>, you can skip installing these packages.

If you want to be able to use LINSTOR to create DRBD replicated storage, you will need to
install the required DRBD packages. Depending on the Linux distribution that you are running on
your node, install the DRBD-related packages that the helper script suggested. If you need to
review the script's suggested packages and installation commands, you can enter:

----
# ./linbit-manage-node.py --hints
----

[[s-linstor-installing-satellite-and-controller]]
===== Installing LINSTOR Packages

To install LINSTOR on a controller node, use your package manager to install the
`linbit-sds-controller` package.

To install LINSTOR on a satellite node, use your package manager to install the
`linbit-sds-satellite` package.

Install both packages if your node will be both a satellite and controller (_Combined_ role).
endif::de-brand[]

[[s-linstor-installation-from-source]]
==== Installing LINSTOR from Source Code

The LINSTOR project's GitHub page is here: https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-server.

LINBIT also has downloadable archived files of source code for LINSTOR, DRBD, and more,
available here:
https://linbit.com/linbit-software-download-page-for-linstor-and-drbd-linux-driver/.

[[s-upgrading]]
=== Upgrading LINSTOR

LINSTOR doesn't support rolling upgrades. Controller and satellites must have the same version,
otherwise the controller will discard the satellite with a `VERSION_MISMATCH`. But this isn't a
problem, as the satellite won't do any actions as long it isn't connected to a controller and
DRBD will not be disrupted by any means.

If you are using the embedded default H2 database and the linstor-controller package is upgraded
an automatic backup file of the database will be created in the default `/var/lib/linstor`
directory. This file is a good restore point if for any reason a linstor-controller database
migration should fail, then it is recommended to report the error to LINBIT and restore the old
database file and roll back to your previous controller version.

If you use any external database or etcd, it is recommended to do a manual backup of your
current database to have a restore point.

First, upgrade the `linstor-controller` and `linstor-client` packages on your controller host
and then restart the `linstor-controller`. The controller should start and all of its clients
should show `OFFLINE(VERSION_MISMATCH)`. After that you can continue upgrading the
`linstor-satellite` package on all satellite nodes and restart them, after a short reconnection
time they should all show `ONLINE` again and your upgrade is finished.

[[s-containers]]
=== Containers

LINSTOR and related software are also available as containers. The base images are available
in LINBIT's container registry, `drbd.io`.

IMPORTANT: LINBIT's container image repository (http://drbd.io) is only available to LINBIT
customers or through LINBIT customer trial accounts.
link:https://linbit.com/contact-us/[Contact LINBIT for information on pricing or to begin a
trial]. Alternatively, you can use LINSTOR SDS' upstream project named
link:https://github.com/piraeusdatastore/piraeus-operator[Piraeus], without being a LINBIT
customer.

To access the images, you first have to login to the registry using your LINBIT Customer Portal
credentials.

----
# docker login drbd.io
----

The containers available in this repository are:

* drbd.io/drbd9-rhel8
* drbd.io/drbd9-rhel7
* drbd.io/drbd9-sles15sp1
* drbd.io/drbd9-bionic
* drbd.io/drbd9-focal
* drbd.io/linstor-csi
* drbd.io/linstor-controller
* drbd.io/linstor-satellite
* drbd.io/linstor-client

An up-to-date list of available images with versions can be retrieved by opening http://drbd.io
in your browser. Be sure to browse the image repository through HTTP, although the registry's
images themselves are pulled through HTTPS, using the associated `docker pull` command.

To load the kernel module, needed only for LINSTOR satellites, you'll need to run a
`drbd9-$dist` container in privileged mode. The kernel module containers either retrieve an
official LINBIT package from a customer repository, use shipped packages, or they try to build
the kernel modules from source. If you intend to build from source, you need to have the
according kernel headers (for example, `kernel-devel`) installed on the host. There are four
ways to execute such a module load container:

* Building from shipped source
* Using a shipped/pre-built kernel module
* Specifying a LINBIT node hash and a distribution.
* Bind-mounting an existing repository configuration.

Example building from shipped source (RHEL based):

----
# docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
  -v /usr/src:/usr/src:ro \
  drbd.io/drbd9-rhel7
----

Example using a module shipped with the container, which is enabled by *not* bind-mounting
`/usr/src`:

----
# docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
  drbd.io/drbd9-rhel8
----

Example using a hash and a distribution (rarely used):

----
# docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
  -e LB_DIST=rhel7.7 -e LB_HASH=ThisIsMyNodeHash \
  drbd.io/drbd9-rhel7
----

Example using an existing repository configuration (rarely used):

----
# docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
  -v /etc/yum.repos.d/linbit.repo:/etc/yum.repos.d/linbit.repo:ro \
  drbd.io/drbd9-rhel7
----

IMPORTANT: In both cases (hash + distribution, and bind-mounting a repository) the hash or
repository configuration has to be from a node that has a special property set. Contact LINBIT customer support for help setting this property.

IMPORTANT: For now (that is, pre DRBD 9 version "9.0.17"), you must use the containerized DRBD
kernel module, as opposed to loading a kernel module onto the host system. If you intend to use
the containers you should not install the DRBD kernel module on your host systems. For DRBD
version 9.0.17 or greater, you can install the kernel module as usual on the host system, but
you need to load the module with the `usermode_helper=disabled` parameter (for example,
`modprobe drbd usermode_helper=disabled`).

Then run the LINSTOR satellite container, also privileged, as a daemon:

----
# docker run -d --name=linstor-satellite --net=host -v /dev:/dev \
  --privileged drbd.io/linstor-satellite
----

NOTE: `net=host` is required for the containerized `drbd-utils` to be able to communicate with
the host-kernel through Netlink.

To run the LINSTOR controller container as a daemon, mapping TCP port `3370` on the host to the
container, enter the following command:

----
# docker run -d --name=linstor-controller -p 3370:3370 drbd.io/linstor-controller
----

To interact with the containerized LINSTOR cluster, you can either use a LINSTOR client
installed on a system using repository packages, or using the containerized LINSTOR client. To
use the LINSTOR client container:

----
# docker run -it --rm -e LS_CONTROLLERS=<controller-host-IP-address> \
  drbd.io/linstor-client node list
----

From this point you would use the LINSTOR client to initialize your cluster and begin creating
resources using the typical LINSTOR patterns.

To stop and remove a daemonized container and image:

----
# docker stop linstor-controller
# docker rm linstor-controller
----

[[s-linstor-init-cluster]]
=== Initializing Your Cluster

Before initializing your LINSTOR cluster, you must meet the following prerequisites on *all*
cluster nodes:

. The DRBD9 kernel module is installed and loaded.
. The `drbd-utils` package is installed.
. `LVM` tools are installed.
. `linstor-controller` or `linstor-satellite` packages and their dependencies are installed on
  appropriate nodes.
. The `linstor-client` is installed on the `linstor-controller` node.

Enable and also start the `linstor-controller` service on the host where it has been installed:

----
# systemctl enable --now linstor-controller
----

[[s-using_the_linstor_client]]
=== Using the LINSTOR Client

Whenever you run the LINSTOR command line client, it needs to know on which cluster node the
`linstor-controller` service is running. If you do not specify this, the client will try to
reach a locally running `linstor-controller` service listening on IP address `127.0.0.1` port
`3370`. Therefore use the `linstor-client` on the same host as the `linstor-controller`.

IMPORTANT: The `linstor-satellite` service requires TCP ports 3366 and 3367. The
`linstor-controller` service requires TCP port 3370. Verify that you have this port allowed on
your firewall.

----
# linstor node list
----

Output from this command should show you an empty list and not an error message.

You can use the `linstor` command on any other machine, but then you need to tell the client how
to find the LINSTOR controller. As shown, this can be specified as a command line option, or by
using an environment variable:

----
# linstor --controllers=alice node list
# LS_CONTROLLERS=alice linstor node list
----

If you have configured <<s-linstor-rest-api-https,HTTPS access to the LINSTOR controller REST
API>> and you want the LINSTOR client to access the controller over HTTPS, then you need to use
the following syntax:

----
# linstor --controllers linstor+ssl://<controller-node-name-or-ip-address>
# LS_CONTROLLERS=linstor+ssl://<controller-node-name-or-ip-address> linstor node list
----

[[s-linstor-configuration-file-specifying-controllers]]
==== Specifying Controllers in the LINSTOR Configuration File

Alternatively, you can create the `/etc/linstor/linstor-client.conf` file and add a
`controllers=` line in the `global` section.

----
[global]
controllers=alice
----

If you have multiple LINSTOR controllers configured you can simply specify them all in a
comma-separated list. The LINSTOR client will try them in the order listed.

[[s-linstor-client-abbreviated-notation]]
==== Using LINSTOR Client Abbreviated Notation

You can use LINSTOR client commands in a much faster and convenient way by only entering the
starting letters of the commands, subcommands, or parameters. For example, rather than entering
`linstor node list` you can enter the LINSTOR short notation command `linstor n l`.

Entering the command `linstor commands` will show a list of possible LINSTOR client commands
along with the abbreviated notation for each command. You can use the `--help` flag with any of
these LINSTOR client commands to get the abbreviated notation for the command's subcommands.

[[s-adding_nodes_to_your_cluster]]
=== Adding Nodes to Your Cluster

After initializing your LINSTOR cluster, the next step is to add nodes to the cluster.

----
# linstor node create bravo 10.43.70.3
----

If you omit the IP address, the LINSTOR client will try to resolve the specified node name,
`bravo` in the preceding example, as a hostname. If the hostname does not resolve to a host on
the network from the system where the LINSTOR controller service is running, then LINSTOR will
show an error message when you try to create the node:

----
Unable to resolve ip address for 'bravo': [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution
----

[[s-linstor-naming-nodes]]
==== Naming LINSTOR Nodes

If you specify an IP address when you create a LINSTOR node, you can give your node an arbitrary
name. The LINSTOR client will show an INFO message about this when you create the node:

----
    [...] 'arbitrary-name' and hostname 'node-1' doesn't match.
----

LINSTOR will automatically detect the created node's local `uname --nodename` which will be
later used for DRBD resource configurations, rather than the arbitrary node name. To avoid
confusing yourself and possibly others, in most cases, it would make sense to just use a node's
hostname when creating a LINSTOR node.

[[s-linstor-satellite-node-starting-and-enabling]]
==== Starting and Enabling a LINSTOR Satellite Node

When you use `linstor node list` LINSTOR will show that the new node is marked as offline. Now
start and enable the LINSTOR satellite service on the new node so that the service comes up on
reboot as well:

----
# systemctl enable --now  linstor-satellite
----

About 10 seconds later you will see the status in `linstor node list` becoming online. Of course
the satellite process might be started before the controller knows about the existence of the
satellite node.

NOTE: In case the node which hosts your controller should also contribute storage to the LINSTOR
cluster, you have to add it as a node and also start the `linstor-satellite` service.

If you want to have other services wait until the linstor-satellite had a chance to create the
necessary devices (that is, after a boot), you can update the corresponding `.service` file and
change `Type=simple` to `Type=notify`.

This will cause the satellite to delay sending the `READY=1` message to systemd until the
controller connects, sends all required data to the satellite and the satellite at least tried
once to get the devices up and running.

[[s-linstor-specifying-node-type]]
==== Specifying LINSTOR Node Types

When you create a LINSTOR node, you can also specify a node type. Node type is a label that
indicates the role that the node serves within your LINSTOR cluster. Node type can be one of
`controller`, `auxiliary`, `combined`, or `satellite`. For example to create a LINSTOR node and
label it as a controller and a satellite node, enter the following command:

----
# linstor node create bravo 10.43.70.3 --node-type combined
----

The `--node-type` argument is optional. If you do not specify a node type when you create a
node, LINSTOR will use a default type of satellite.

If you want to change a LINSTOR node's assigned type after creating the node, you can enter a
`linstor node modify --node-type` command.

[[s-storage_pools]]
=== Storage Pools

<<StoragePool,StoragePools>> identify storage in the context of LINSTOR. To group storage pools
from multiple nodes, simply use the same name on each node. For example, one valid approach is
to give all SSDs one name and all HDDs another.

[[s-linstor-storage-pools-creating]]
==== Creating Storage Pools

On each host contributing storage, you need to create either an LVM volume group (VG) or a ZFS
zPool. The VGs and zPools identified with one LINSTOR storage pool name might have different VG
or zPool names on the hosts, but do yourself a favor, for coherency, use the same VG or zPool
name on all nodes.

----
# vgcreate vg_ssd /dev/nvme0n1 /dev/nvme1n1 [...]
----

After creating a volume group on each of your nodes, you can create a storage pool that is
backed by the volume group on each of your nodes, by entering the following commands:

----
# linstor storage-pool create lvm alpha pool_ssd vg_ssd
# linstor storage-pool create lvm bravo pool_ssd vg_ssd
----

To list your storage pools you can enter:

----
# linstor storage-pool list
----

or using LINSTOR abbreviated notation:

----
# linstor sp l
----

////
In case anything goes wrong with the storage pool's VG/zPool, e.g. the VG having been renamed or
somehow became invalid you can delete the storage pool in LINSTOR with the following command,
given that only resources with all their volumes in the so-called 'lost' storage pool are
attached. This feature is available since LINSTOR v0.9.13.

----
# linstor storage-pool lost alpha pool_ssd
----

or using the short version

----
# linstor sp lo alpha pool_ssd
----

Should the deletion of the storage pool be prevented due to attached resources or snapshots with
some of its volumes in another still functional storage pool, hints will be given in the
'status' column of the corresponding list-command (e.g. `linstor resource list`). After deleting
the LINSTOR-objects in the lost storage pool manually, the lost-command can be executed again to
ensure a complete deletion of the storage pool and its remaining objects.
////

[[s-a_storage_pool_per_backend_device]]
==== Using Storage Pools To Confine Failure Domains to a Single Back-end Device

In clusters where you have only one kind of storage and the capability to hot swap storage
devices, you might choose a model where you create one storage pool per physical backing device.
The advantage of this model is to confine failure domains to a single storage device.

[[s-storage_pools_shared_by_multiple_nodes]]
==== Sharing Storage Pools with Multiple Nodes

Both the Exos and LVM2 storage providers offer the option of multiple server nodes directly
connected to the storage array and drives. With LVM2 the external locking service (`lvmlockd`)
manages volume groups created with the --shared options with `vgcreate`. The `--shared-space`
can be used when configuring a LINSTOR pool to use the same LVM2 volume group accessible by two
or more nodes. The example below shows using the LVM2 volume group UUID as the shared space
identifier for a pool accessible by nodes alpha and bravo:

----
# linstor storage-pool create lvm --external-locking \
  --shared-space O1btSy-UO1n-lOAo-4umW-ETZM-sxQD-qT4V87 \
  alpha pool_ssd shared_vg_ssd
# linstor storage-pool create lvm --external-locking \
  --shared-space O1btSy-UO1n-lOAo-4umW-ETZM-sxQD-qT4V87 \
  bravo pool_ssd shared_vg_ssd
----

Exos pools will use the Exos pool serial number by default for the shared-space identifier.

IMPORTANT: As of the release of `linstor-server` v1.26.0, the Exos integration for LINSTOR is
deprecated.

[[s-physical-storage-command]]
==== Creating Storage Pools by Using the Physical Storage Command

Since `linstor-server` 1.5.2 and a recent `linstor-client`, LINSTOR can create LVM/ZFS pools on
a satellite for you. The LINSTOR client has the following commands to list possible disks and
create storage pools, but such LVM/ZFS pools are not managed by LINSTOR and there is no delete
command, so such action must be done manually on the nodes.

----
# linstor physical-storage list
----

Will give you a list of available disks grouped by size and rotational(SSD/Magnetic Disk).

It will only show disks that pass the following filters:

* The device size must be greater than 1GiB.
* The device is a root device (not having children), for example, `/dev/vda`, `/dev/sda`.
* The device does not have any file system or other `blkid` marker (`wipefs -a` might be needed).
* The device is not a DRBD device.


With the `create-device-pool` command you can create a LVM pool on a disk and also directly
add it as a storage pool in LINSTOR.

----
# linstor physical-storage create-device-pool --pool-name lv_my_pool \
  LVMTHIN node_alpha /dev/vdc --storage-pool newpool
----

If the `--storage-pool` option was provided, LINSTOR will create a storage pool with the given
name.

For more options and exact command usage refer to the LINSTOR client `--help` text.

[[s-linstor-storage-pool-mixing]]
==== Mixing Storage Pools

With some setup and configuration, you can use storage pools of different <<s-storage-providers,storage provider>> types to back a LINSTOR resource.
This is called storage pool mixing.
For example, you might have a storage pool on one node that uses an LVM thick-provisioned volume while on another node you have a storage pool that uses a thin-provisioned ZFS zpool. 

Because most LINSTOR deployments will use homogenous storage pools to back resources, storage pool mixing is only mentioned here so that you know that the feature exists.
It might be a useful feature when migrating storage resources, for example.
You can find further details about this, including prerequisites, in <<s-linstor-storage-providers-storage-pool-mixing>>. 

[[s-linstor-resource-groups]]
=== Using Resource Groups to Deploy LINSTOR Provisioned Volumes

Using resource groups to define how you want your resources provisioned should be considered the
de facto method for deploying volumes provisioned by LINSTOR. Chapters that follow which
describe creating each _resource_ from a _resource definition_ and _volume definition_ should
only be used in special scenarios.

IMPORTANT: Even if you choose not to create and use _resource groups_ in your LINSTOR cluster, all
resources created from _resource definitions_ and _volume definitions_ will exist in the
'DfltRscGrp' _resource group_.

A simple pattern for deploying resources using resource groups would look like this:

----
# linstor resource-group create my_ssd_group --storage-pool pool_ssd --place-count 2
# linstor volume-group create my_ssd_group
# linstor resource-group spawn-resources my_ssd_group my_ssd_res 20G
----

The commands above would result in a resource named 'my_ssd_res' with a 20GB volume replicated
twice being automatically provisioned from nodes who participate in the storage pool named
'pool_ssd'.

A more useful pattern could be to create a resource group with settings you've determined are
optimal for your use case. Perhaps you have to run nightly online verifications of your volumes'
consistency, in that case, you could create a resource group with the 'verify-alg' of your
choice already set so that resources spawned from the group are pre-configured with 'verify-alg'
set:

----
# linstor resource-group create my_verify_group --storage-pool pool_ssd --place-count 2
# linstor resource-group drbd-options --verify-alg crc32c my_verify_group
# linstor volume-group create my_verify_group
# for i in {00..19}; do
    linstor resource-group spawn-resources my_verify_group res$i 10G
  done
----

The commands above result in twenty 10GiB resources being created each with the `crc32c`
`verify-alg` pre-configured.

You can tune the settings of individual resources or volumes spawned from resource groups by
setting options on the respective resource definition or volume definition LINSTOR objects. For
example, if `res11` from the preceding example is used by a very active database receiving many
small random writes, you might want to increase the `al-extents` for that specific resource:

----
# linstor resource-definition drbd-options --al-extents 6007 res11
----

If you configure a setting in a resource definition that is already configured on the
resource group it was spawned from, the value set in the resource definition will override
the value set on the parent resource group. For example, if the same `res11` was required to
use the slower but more secure `sha256` hash algorithm in its verifications, setting the
`verify-alg` on the resource definition for `res11` would override the value set on the
resource group:

----
# linstor resource-definition drbd-options --verify-alg sha256 res11
----

TIP: A guiding rule for the hierarchy in which settings are inherited is that the value "closer"
to the resource or volume wins. Volume definition settings take precedence over volume group
settings, and resource definition settings take precedence over resource group settings.

[[s-linstor-set-config]]
=== Configuring a Cluster

[[s-available_storage_plugins]]
==== indexterm:[linstor, storage plugins]Available Storage Plugins

LINSTOR has the following supported storage plugins at the time of writing:

* Thick LVM
* Thin LVM with a single thin pool
* Thick ZFS
* Thin ZFS

[[s-linstor-new-volume]]
=== Creating and Deploying Resources and Volumes

You can use the LINSTOR `create` command to create various LINSTOR objects, such as resource
definitions, volume definitions, and resources. Some of these commands are shown below.

In the following example scenario, assume that you have a goal of creating a resource named
`backups` with a size of 500GiB that is replicated among three cluster nodes.

First, create a new resource definition:

----
# linstor resource-definition create backups
----

Second, create a new volume definition within that resource definition:

----
# linstor volume-definition create backups 500G
----

If you want to resize (grow or shrink) the volume definition you can do that by specifying a new
size with the `set-size` command:

----
# linstor volume-definition set-size backups 0 100G
----

IMPORTANT: The size of a volume definition can only be decreased if it has no associated
resource. However, you can freely increase the size of a volume definition, even one having a
deployed resource.

The parameter `0` is the number of the volume in the resource `backups`. You have to provide
this parameter because resources can have multiple volumes that are identified by a so-called
volume number. You can find this number by listing the volume definitions (`linstor vd l`). The
list table will show volume numbers for the listed resources.

So far you have only created definition objects in LINSTOR's database. However, not a single
logical volume (LV) has been created on the satellite nodes. Now you have the choice of
delegating the task of deploying resources to LINSTOR or else doing it yourself.

[[s-manual_placement]]
==== Manually Placing Resources

With the `resource create` command you can assign a resource definition to named nodes
explicitly.

----
# linstor resource create alpha backups --storage-pool pool_hdd
# linstor resource create bravo backups --storage-pool pool_hdd
# linstor resource create charlie backups --storage-pool pool_hdd
----

[[s-autoplace-linstor]]
==== Automatically Placing Resources

When you create (spawn) a resource from a resource group, it is possible to have LINSTOR
automatically select nodes and storage pools to deploy the resource to. You can use the
arguments mentioned in this section to specify constraints when you create or modify a resource
group. These constraints will affect how LINSTOR automatically places resources that are
deployed from the resource group.

===== Automatically Maintaining Resource Group Placement Count

Starting with LINSTOR version 1.26.0, there is a reoccurring LINSTOR task that tries to maintain
the placement count set on a resource group for all deployed LINSTOR resources that belong to
that resource group. This includes the default LINSTOR resource group and its placement count.

If you want to disable this behavior, set the `BalanceResourcesEnabled` property to false on the
the LINSTOR controller, LINSTOR resource groups that your resources belong to, or the resource
definitions themselves. Due to LINSTOR object hierarchy, if you set a property on a resource
group, it will override the property value on the LINSTOR controller. Likewise, if you set a
property on a resource definition, it will override the property value on the resource group
that the resource definition belongs to.

There are other additional properties related to this feature that you can set on the LINSTOR
controller: 

`BalanceResourcesInterval`:: The interval in seconds, at the LINSTOR controller level, that the
balance resource placement task is triggered. By default, the interval is 3600 seconds (one
hour).

`BalanceResourcesGracePeriod`:: The period in seconds for how long new resources (after being
created or spawned) are ignored for balancing. By default, the grace period is 3600 seconds (one
hour).

[[s-linstor-placement-count-rg-feature]]
===== Placement Count

By using the `--place-count <replica_count>` argument when you create or modify a resource
group, you can specify on how many nodes in your cluster LINSTOR should place diskful resources
created from the resource group.

[WARNING]
.Creating a resource group with impossible placement constraints
====
You can create or modify a resource group and specify a placement count or other constraint that
would be impossible for LINSTOR to fulfill. For example, you could specify a placement count of
`7` when you only have three nodes in your cluster. LINSTOR will create such a resource group
without complaining. However, LINSTOR will display an error message when you try to spawn a
resource from the resource group. For example:

----
ERROR:
Description:
    Not enough available nodes
[...]
----
====

===== Storage Pool Placement

In the following example, the value after the `--place-count` option tells LINSTOR how many
replicas you want to have. The `--storage-pool` option should be obvious.

----
# linstor resource-group create backups --place-count 3 --storage-pool pool_hdd
----

What might not be obvious is that you can omit the `--storage-pool` option. If you do this, then
LINSTOR can select a storage pool on its own when you create (spawn) resources from the resource
group. The selection follows these rules:

  * Ignore all nodes and storage pools the current user has no access to
  * Ignore all diskless storage pools
  * Ignore all storage pools not having enough free space

The remaining storage pools will be rated by different strategies.

`MaxFreeSpace`:: This strategy maps the rating 1:1 to the remaining free space of the storage
pool. However, this strategy only considers the actually allocated space (in case of
thin-provisioned storage pool this might grow with time without creating new resources)

`MinReservedSpace`:: Unlike the "MaxFreeSpace", this strategy considers the reserved space. That
is the space that a thin volume can grow to before reaching its limit. The sum of reserved
spaces might exceed the storage pool's capacity, which is as overprovisioning.

`MinRscCount`:: Simply the count of resources already deployed in a given storage pool

`MaxThroughput`:: For this strategy, the storage pool's `Autoplacer/MaxThroughput` property is
the base of the score, or 0 if the property is not present. Every Volume deployed in the given
storage pool will subtract its defined `sys/fs/blkio_throttle_read` and
`sys/fs/blkio_throttle_write` property- value from the storage pool's max throughput. The
resulting score might be negative.

The scores of the strategies will be normalized, weighted and summed up, where the scores of
minimizing strategies will be converted first to allow an overall maximization of the resulting
score.

You can configure the weights of the strategies to affect how LINSTOR selects a storage pool for
resource placement when creating (spawning) resources for which you did not specify a storage
pool. You do this by setting the following properties on the LINSTOR controller object. The
weight can be an arbitrary decimal value.

----
linstor controller set-property Autoplacer/Weights/MaxFreeSpace <weight>
linstor controller set-property Autoplacer/Weights/MinReservedSpace <weight>
linstor controller set-property Autoplacer/Weights/MinRscCount <weight>
linstor controller set-property Autoplacer/Weights/MaxThroughput <weight>
----

NOTE: To keep the behavior of the Autoplacer compatible with previous LINSTOR versions, all
strategies have a default-weight of 0, except the `MaxFreeSpace` which has a weight of 1.

NOTE: Neither 0 nor a negative score will prevent a storage pool from getting selected. A
storage pool with these scores will just be considered later.

Finally, LINSTOR tries to find the best matching group of storage pools meeting all
requirements. This step also considers other auto-placement restrictions such as
`--replicas-on-same`, `--replicas-on-different`, `--do-not-place-with`,
`--do-not-place-with-regex`, `--layer-list`, and `--providers`.

===== Avoiding Colocating Resources When Automatically Placing a Resource

The `--do-not-place-with <resource_name_to_avoid>` argument specifies that LINSTOR should try to
avoid placing a resource on nodes that already have the specified, `resource_name_to_avoid`
resource deployed.

By using the `--do-not-place-with-regex <regular_expression>` argument, you can specify that
LINSTOR should try to avoid placing a resource on nodes that already have a resource deployed
whose name matches the regular expression that you provide with the argument. In this way, you
can specify multiple resources to try to avoid placing your resource with.

===== Constraining Automatic Resource Placement by Using Auxiliary Node Properties

You can constrain automatic resource placement to place (or avoid placing) a resource with nodes
having a specified auxiliary node property.

NOTE: This ability can be particularly useful if you are trying to constrain resource placement
within Kubernetes environments that use LINSTOR managed storage. For example, you might set an
auxiliary node property that corresponds to a Kubernetes label. See the
<<linstor-kubernetes.adoc#s-kubernetes-replicasonsame,"replicasOnSame" section>> within the
"LINSTOR Volumes in Kubernetes" _LINSTOR User's Guide_ chapter for more details about this use
case.

The arguments, `--replicas-on-same` and `--replicas-on-different` expect the
name of a property within the `Aux/` namespace.

The following example shows setting an auxiliary node property, `testProperty`, on three LINSTOR
satellite nodes. Next, you create a resource group, `testRscGrp`, with a placement count of two
and a constraint to place spawned resources on nodes that have a `testProperty` value of `1`.
After creating a volume group, you can spawn a resource from the resource group. For simplicity,
output from the following commands is not shown.

----
# for i in {0,2}; do linstor node set-property --aux node-$i testProperty 1; done
# linstor node set-property --aux node-1 testProperty 0
# linstor resource-group create testRscGrp --place-count 2 --replicas-on-same testProperty=1
# linstor volume-group create testRscGrp
# linstor resource-group spawn-resources testRscGrp testResource 100M
----

You can verify the placement of the spawned resource by using the following command:

----
# linstor resource list
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ResourceName      | Node   | Port | Usage  | Conns |    State | CreatedOn           |
|=====================================================================================|
| testResource      | node-0 | 7000 | Unused | Ok    | UpToDate | 2022-07-27 16:14:16 |
| testResource      | node-2 | 7000 | Unused | Ok    | UpToDate | 2022-07-27 16:14:16 |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
----

Because of the `--replicas-on-same` constraint, LINSTOR did not place the spawned resource on
satellite node `node-1`, because the value of its auxiliary node property, `testProperty` was
`0` and not `1`.

You can verify the node properties of `node-1`, by using the `list-properties` command:

----
# linstor node list-properties node-1
+----------------------------+
| Key              | Value   |
|============================|
| Aux/testProperty | 0       |
| CurStltConnName  | default |
| NodeUname        | node-1  |
+----------------------------+
----

===== Constraining Automatic Resource Placement by LINSTOR Layers or Storage Pool Providers

You can specify the `--layer-list` or `--providers` arguments, followed by a comma-separated
values (CSV) list of LINSTOR layers or storage pool providers, to influence where LINSTOR places
resources. The possible layers and storage pool providers that you can specify in your CSV
list can be shown by using the `--help` option with the `--auto-place` option. A CSV list of
layers would constrain automatic resource placement for a specified resource group to nodes that
have storage that conformed with your list. Consider the following command:

----
# linstor resource-group create my_luks_rg --place-count 3 --layer-list drbd,luks
----

Resources that you might later create (spawn) from this resource group would be deployed across
three nodes having storage pools backed by
a DRBD layer backed by a LUKS layer (and implicitly backed by a "storage" layer). The order of
layers that you specify in your CSV list is "top-down", where a layer on the left in the list is
above a layer on its right.

The `--providers` argument can be used to constrain automatic resource placement to only storage
pools that match those in a specified CSV list. You can use this argument to have explicit
control over which storage pools will back your deployed resource. If for example, you had a
mixed environment of `ZFS`, `LVM`, and `LVM_THIN` storage pools in your cluster, by using the
`--providers LVM,LVM_THIN` argument, you can specify that a resource only gets backed by either
an `LVM` or `LVM_THIN` storage pool, when using the `--place-count` option.

NOTE: The `--providers` argument's CSV list does not specify an order of priority for the list
elements. Instead, LINSTOR will use factors like additional placement constraints,
available free space, and LINSTOR's storage pool selection strategies that were previously
described, when placing a resource.

[[s-autoplace-linstor-resource-create]]
===== Automatically Placing Resources When Creating Them

While using resource groups to create templates from which you can create (spawn) resources from
is the standard way to create resources, you can also create resources directly by using the
`resource create` command. When you use this command, it is also possible to specify arguments
that affect how LINSTOR will place the resource in your storage cluster.

With the exception of the placement count argument, the arguments that you can specify when you
use the `resource create` command that affect where LINSTOR places the resource are the same as
those for the `resource-group create` command. Specifying an `--auto-place <replica_count>`
argument with a `resource create` command is the same as specifying a `--place-count
<replica_count>` argument with a `resource-group create` command.

====== Using Auto-place to Extend Existing Resource Deployments

Besides the argument name, there is another difference between the placement count argument for
the resource group and resource `create` commands. With the `resource create` command, you can
also specify a value of `+1` with the `--auto-place` argument, if you want to extend existing
resource deployments.

By using this value, LINSTOR will create an additional replica, no matter
what the `--place-count` is configured for on the resource group that the resource
was created from.

For example, you can use an `--auto-place +1` argument to deploy an additional replica of the
`testResource` resource used in a previous example. You will first need to set the auxiliary
node property, `testProperty` to `1` on `node-1`. Otherwise, LINSTOR will not be able to deploy
the replica because of the previously configured `--replicas-on-same` constraint. For
simplicity, not all output from the commands below is shown.

----
# linstor node set-property --aux node-1 testProperty 1
# linstor resource create --auto-place +1 testResource
# linstor resource list
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ResourceName      | Node   | Port | Usage  | Conns |    State | CreatedOn           |
|=====================================================================================|
| testResource      | node-0 | 7000 | Unused | Ok    | UpToDate | 2022-07-27 16:14:16 |
| testResource      | node-1 | 7000 | Unused | Ok    | UpToDate | 2022-07-28 19:27:30 |
| testResource      | node-2 | 7000 | Unused | Ok    | UpToDate | 2022-07-27 16:14:16 |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
----

WARNING: The `+1` value is not valid for the `resource-group create --place-count` command. This
is because the command does not deploy resources, it only creates templates from which to deploy
them later.

[[s-linstor-deleting-resource-tasks]]
=== Deleting Resources, Resource Definitions, and Resource Groups

You can delete LINSTOR resources, resource definitions, and resource groups by using the
`delete` command after the LINSTOR object that you want to delete. Depending on which object you
delete, there will be different implications for your LINSTOR cluster and other associated
LINSTOR objects.

[[s-linstor-deleting-resource-definitions]]
==== Deleting a Resource Definition

You can delete a resource definition by using the command:

----
# linstor resource-definition delete <resource_definition_name>
----

This will remove the named resource definition from the entire LINSTOR cluster. The resource is
removed from all nodes and the resource entry is marked for removal from LINSTOR's database
tables. After LINSTOR has removed the resource from all the nodes, the resource entry is
removed from LINSTOR's database tables.

WARNING: If your resource definition has existing snapshots, you will not be able to delete the
resource definition until you delete its snapshots. See the
<<s-linstor-snapshots-removing-a-snapshot>> section in this guide.

[[s-linstor-deleting-resources]]
==== Deleting a Resource

You can delete a resource using the command:

----
# linstor resource delete <node_name> <resource_name>
----

Unlike deleting a resource definition, this command will only delete a LINSTOR resource from the
node (or nodes) that you specify. The resource is removed from the node and the resource entry
is marked for removal from LINSTOR's database tables. After LINSTOR has removed the resource
from the node, the resource entry is removed from LINSTOR's database tables.

Deleting a LINSTOR resource might have implications for a cluster, beyond just removing the
resource. For example, if the resource is backed by a DRBD layer, removing a resource from one
node in a three node cluster could also remove certain quorum related DRBD options, if any
existed for the resource. After removing such a resource from a node in a three node cluster,
the resource would no longer have quorum as it would now only be deployed on two nodes in the
three node cluster.

After running a `linstor resource delete` command to remove a resource from a single node, you
might see informational messages such as:

----
INFO:
    Resource-definition property 'DrbdOptions/Resource/quorum' was removed as there are not enough resources for quorum
INFO:
    Resource-definition property 'DrbdOptions/Resource/on-no-quorum' was removed as there are not enough resources for quorum
----

Also unlike deleting a resource definition, you can delete a resource while there are existing
snapshots of the resource's storage pool. Any existing snapshots for the resource's storage pool
will persist.

[[s-linstor-deleting-resource-groups]]
==== Deleting a Resource Group

You can delete a resource group by using the command:

----
# linstor resource-group delete <resource_group_name>
----

As you might expect, this command deletes the named resource group. You can only delete a
resource group if it has no associated resource definitions, otherwise LINSTOR will present an
error message, such as:

----
ERROR:
Description:
    Cannot delete resource group 'my_rg' because it has existing resource definitions.
----

To resolve this error so that you can delete the resource group, you can either delete the
associated resource definitions, or your can move the resource definitions to another (existing)
resource group:

----
# linstor resource-definition modify <resource_definition_name> \
--resource-group <another_resource_group_name>
----

You can find which resource definitions are associated with your resource group by entering
the following command:

----
# linstor resource-definition list
----


[[s-export-import-db]]
=== Backup and Restore Database

Since version 1.24.0, LINSTOR has a tool that you can use to export and import a LINSTOR database.

This tool has an executable file called `/usr/share/linstor-server/bin/linstor-database`. This
executable has two subcommands, `export-db` and `import-db`. Both subcommands accept an optional
`--config-directory` argument that you can use to specify the directory containing the
`linstor.toml` configuration file.

IMPORTANT: To ensure a consistent database backup, take the controller offline by stopping the
controller service as shown in the commands below, before creating a backup of the LINSTOR
database.

[[s-export-db]]
==== Backing Up the Database

To backup the LINSTOR database to a new file named `db_export` in your home directory, enter the
following commands:

----
# systemctl stop linstor-controller
# /usr/share/linstor-server/bin/linstor-database export-db ~/db_export
# systemctl start linstor-controller
----

NOTE: You can use the `--config-directory` argument with the `linstor-database` utility to
specify a LINSTOR configuration directory if needed. If you omit this argument, the utility uses
the `/etc/linstor` directory by default.

After backing up the database, you can copy the backup file to a safe place.

----
# cp ~/db_export <somewhere safe>
----

The resulting database backup is a plain JSON document, containing not just the actual data, but
also some metadata about when the backup was created, from which database, and other
information.

[[s-import-db]]
==== Restoring the Database From a Backup

Restoring the database from a previously made backup is similar to `export-db` from the
<<s-export-db,previous section>>.

For example, to restore the previously made backup from the `db_export` file, enter the
following commands:

----
# systemctl stop linstor-controller
# /usr/share/linstor-server/bin/linstor-database import-db ~/db_export
# systemctl start linstor-controller
----

You can only import a database from a previous backup if the currently installed version of
LINSTOR is the same (or higher) version as the version that you created the backup from. If the
currently installed LINSTOR version is higher than the version that the database backup was
created from, when you import the backup the data will be restored with the same database scheme
of the version used during the export. Then, the next time that the controller starts, the
controller will detect that the database has an old scheme and it will automatically migrate the
data to the scheme of the current version.

[[s-convert-db]]
==== Converting Databases

Since the exported database file contains some metadata, an exported database file can be
imported into a different database type than it was exported from.

This allows the user to convert, for example, from an etcd setup to an SQL based setup. There
is no special command for converting the database format. You only have to specify the correct
`linstor.toml` configuration file by using the `--config-directory` argument (or updating the
default `/etc/linstor/linstor.toml` and specifying the database type that you want to use before
importing). See the <<#s-linstor-external-database,LINSTOR User's Guide>> for more information
about specifying a database type. Regardless of the type of database that the backup was created
from, it will be imported in the database type that is specified in the `linstor.toml`
configuration file.

[[s-more-about-linstor]]
== Further LINSTOR Tasks

[[s-linstor_ha]]
=== Creating a Highly Available LINSTOR Cluster

By default a LINSTOR cluster consists of exactly one active LINSTOR controller node. Making
LINSTOR highly available involves providing replicated storage for the controller database,
multiple LINSTOR controller nodes where only one is active at a time, and a service manager
(here DRBD Reactor) that takes care of mounting and unmounting the highly available storage as
well as starting and stopping the LINSTOR controller service on nodes.

[[s-linstor_ha-configuring-ha-linstor-database-storage]]
==== Configuring Highly Available LINSTOR Database Storage

To configure the highly available storage, you can use LINSTOR itself. One of the
benefits of having the storage under LINSTOR control is that you can easily extend the HA
storage to new cluster nodes.

[[s-linstor_ha-creating-res-group-for-ha-database-storage]]
===== Creating a Resource Group For The HA LINSTOR Database Storage Resource 

First, create a resource group, here named `linstor-db-grp`, from which you will later spawn the
resource that will back the LINSTOR database. You will need to adapt the storage pool name to
match an existing storage pool in your environment.

----
# linstor resource-group create \
--storage-pool my-thin-pool \
--place-count 3 \
--diskless-on-remaining true \
linstor-db-grp
----

Next, set the necessary DRBD options on the resource group. Resources that you spawn from the
resource group will inherit these options.

----
# linstor resource-group drbd-options \
--auto-promote=no \
--quorum=majority \
--on-suspended-primary-outdated=force-secondary \
--on-no-quorum=io-error \
--on-no-data-accessible=io-error \
--rr-conflict=retry-connect \
linstor-db-grp
----

IMPORTANT: It is crucial that your cluster qualifies for auto-quorum and uses the `io-error`
policy (see Section <<s-linstor-auto-quorum>>), and that `auto-promote` is disabled.

[[s-linstor_ha-creating-vol-group-for-ha-database-storage]]
===== Creating a Volume Group For The HA LINSTOR Database Storage Resource 

Next, create a volume group that references your resource group.

----
# linstor volume-group create linstor-db-grp
----

[[s-linstor_ha-creating-resource-for-ha-database-storage]]
===== Creating a Resource For The HA LINSTOR Database Storage

Now you can spawn a new LINSTOR resource from the resource group that you created. The resource
is named `linstor_db` and will be 200MiB in size, Because of the parameters that you specified
when you created the resource group, LINSTOR will place the resource in the `my-thin-pool`
storage pool on three satellite nodes in your cluster.

----
# linstor resource-group spawn-resources linstor-db-grp linstor_db 200M
----

[[s-linstor_ha-moving-linstor-database-to-ha-storage]]
==== Moving the LINSTOR Database to HA Storage

After creating the `linstor_db` resource, you can move the LINSTOR database to the new storage
and create a systemd mount service. First, stop the current controller service and disable it,
as it will be managed by DRBD Reactor later.

----
# systemctl disable --now linstor-controller
----

Next, create the systemd mount service.

----
# cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/var-lib-linstor.mount
[Unit]
Description=Filesystem for the LINSTOR controller

[Mount]
# you can use the minor like /dev/drbdX or the udev symlink
What=/dev/drbd/by-res/linstor_db/0
Where=/var/lib/linstor
EOF

# mv /var/lib/linstor{,.orig}
# mkdir /var/lib/linstor
# chattr +i /var/lib/linstor # only if on LINSTOR >= 1.14.0
# drbdadm primary linstor_db
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/drbd/by-res/linstor_db/0
# systemctl start var-lib-linstor.mount
# cp -r /var/lib/linstor.orig/* /var/lib/linstor
# systemctl start linstor-controller
----

Copy the `/etc/systemd/system/var-lib-linstor.mount` mount file to all the cluster nodes that
you want to have the potential to run the LINSTOR controller service (standby controller nodes).
Again, do not `systemctl enable` any of these services because DRBD Reactor will manage them.

==== Installing Multiple LINSTOR Controllers

The next step is to install LINSTOR controllers on all nodes that have access to the
`linstor_db` DRBD resource (as they need to mount the DRBD volume) and which you want to become
a possible LINSTOR controller. It is important that the controllers are manged by
`drbd-reactor`, so verify that the `linstor-controller.service` is disabled on all nodes! To be
sure, execute `systemctl disable linstor-controller` on all cluster nodes and `systemctl stop
linstor-controller` on all nodes except the one it is currently running from the previous step.
Also verify that you have set `chattr +i /var/lib/linstor` on all potential controller nodes if
you use LINSTOR version equal or greater to 1.14.0.

==== Managing the Services

For starting and stopping the mount service and the `linstor-controller` service, use
link:https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/drbd-guide-9_0-en/#ch-drbd-reactor[DRBD Reactor].
Install this component on all nodes that could become a LINSTOR controller and edit their
`/etc/drbd-reactor.d/linstor_db.toml` configuration file. It should contain an enabled promoter
plugin section like this:

----
[[promoter]]
id = "linstor_db"
[promoter.resources.linstor_db]
start = ["var-lib-linstor.mount", "linstor-controller.service"]
----

Depending on your requirements you might also want to set an `on-stop-failure` action and set
`stop-services-on-exit`.

After that restart `drbd-reactor` and enable it on all the nodes you configured it.

----
# systemctl restart drbd-reactor
# systemctl enable drbd-reactor
----

Check that there are no warnings from `drbd-reactor` service in the logs by running `systemctl
status drbd-reactor`. As there is already an active LINSTOR controller things will just stay
the way they are. Run `drbd-reactorctl status linstor_db` to check the health of the linstor_db
target unit.

The last but nevertheless important step is to configure the LINSTOR satellite services to not
delete (and then regenerate) the resource file for the LINSTOR controller DB at its startup. Do
not edit the service files directly, but use `systemctl edit`. Edit the service file on all
nodes that could become a LINSTOR controller and that are also LINSTOR satellites.

----
# systemctl edit linstor-satellite
[Service]
Environment=LS_KEEP_RES=linstor_db
----

After this change you should execute `systemctl restart linstor-satellite` on all satellite
nodes.

CAUTION: Be sure to configure your LINSTOR client for use with multiple controllers as described
in the section titled, <<s-using_the_linstor_client>> and verify that you also configured your
integration plugins (for example, the Proxmox plugin) to be ready for multiple LINSTOR
controllers.

[[s-drbd_clients]]
=== DRBD Clients

By using the `--drbd-diskless` option instead of `--storage-pool` you can have a permanently
diskless DRBD device on a node. This means that the resource will appear as block device and can
be mounted to the file system without an existing storage-device. The data of the resource is
accessed over the network on another node with the same resource.

----
# linstor resource create delta backups --drbd-diskless
----

NOTE: The option `--diskless` is deprecated. Use the `--drbd-diskless` or `--nvme-initiator`
commands instead.

[[s-linstor-drbd-consistency-group-multiple-volumes]]
=== DRBD Consistency Groups (Multiple Volumes within a Resource)

The so called consistency group is a feature from DRBD. It is mentioned in this user's guide,
due to the fact that one of LINSTOR's main functions is to manage storage-clusters with DRBD.
Multiple volumes in one resource are a consistency group.

This means that changes on different volumes from one resource are getting replicated in the
same chronological order on the other Satellites.

Therefore you don't have to worry about the timing if you have interdependent data on different
volumes in a resource.

To deploy more than one volume in a LINSTOR-resource you have to create two volume-definitions
with the same name.

----
# linstor volume-definition create backups 500G
# linstor volume-definition create backups 100G

[[s-volumes_of_one_resource_to_different_storage_pools]]
=== Placing Volumes of One Resource in Different Storage Pools

This can be achieved by setting the `StorPoolName` property to the volume definitions before the
resource is deployed to the nodes:

----
# linstor resource-definition create backups
# linstor volume-definition create backups 500G
# linstor volume-definition create backups 100G
# linstor volume-definition set-property backups 0 StorPoolName pool_hdd
# linstor volume-definition set-property backups 1 StorPoolName pool_ssd
# linstor resource create alpha backups
# linstor resource create bravo backups
# linstor resource create charlie backups
----

NOTE: Since the `volume-definition create` command is used without the `--vlmnr` option LINSTOR
assigned the volume numbers starting at 0. In the following two lines the 0 and 1 refer to these
automatically assigned volume numbers.

Here the 'resource create' commands do not need a `--storage-pool` option. In this case LINSTOR
uses a 'fallback' storage pool. Finding that storage pool, LINSTOR queries the properties of the
following objects in the following order:

* Volume definition
* Resource
* Resource definition
* Node

If none of those objects contain a `StorPoolName` property, the controller falls back to a
hard-coded 'DfltStorPool' string as a storage pool.

This also means that if you forgot to define a storage pool prior deploying a resource, you will
get an error message that LINSTOR could not find the storage pool named 'DfltStorPool'.

[[s-linstor-without-drbd]]
=== Using LINSTOR Without DRBD

LINSTOR can be used without DRBD as well. Without DRBD, LINSTOR is able to provision volumes
from LVM and ZFS backed storage pools, and create those volumes on individual nodes in your
LINSTOR cluster.

Currently LINSTOR supports the creation of LVM and ZFS volumes with the option of layering some
combinations of LUKS, DRBD, or NVMe-oF/NVMe-TCP on top of those volumes.

For example, assume you have a Thin LVM backed storage pool defined in your LINSTOR cluster
named, `thin-lvm`:

----
# linstor --no-utf8 storage-pool list
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| StoragePool | Node      | Driver   | PoolName          | ... |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| thin-lvm    | linstor-a | LVM_THIN | drbdpool/thinpool | ... |
| thin-lvm    | linstor-b | LVM_THIN | drbdpool/thinpool | ... |
| thin-lvm    | linstor-c | LVM_THIN | drbdpool/thinpool | ... |
| thin-lvm    | linstor-d | LVM_THIN | drbdpool/thinpool | ... |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
----

You could use LINSTOR to create a Thin LVM on `linstor-d` that's 100GiB in size using the
following commands:

----
# linstor resource-definition create rsc-1
# linstor volume-definition create rsc-1 100GiB
# linstor resource create --layer-list storage \
          --storage-pool thin-lvm linstor-d rsc-1
----

You should then see you have a new Thin LVM on `linstor-d`. You can extract the device path from
LINSTOR by listing your linstor resources with the `--machine-readable` flag set:

----
# linstor --machine-readable resource list | grep device_path
            "device_path": "/dev/drbdpool/rsc-1_00000",
----

If you wanted to layer DRBD on top of this volume, which is the default `--layer-list` option in
LINSTOR for ZFS or LVM backed volumes, you would use the following resource creation pattern
instead:

----
# linstor resource-definition create rsc-1
# linstor volume-definition create rsc-1 100GiB
# linstor resource create --layer-list drbd,storage \
          --storage-pool thin-lvm linstor-d rsc-1
----

You would then see that you have a new Thin LVM backing a DRBD volume on `linstor-d`:

----
# linstor --machine-readable resource list | grep -e device_path -e backing_disk
            "device_path": "/dev/drbd1000",
            "backing_disk": "/dev/drbdpool/rsc-1_00000",
----

The following table shows which layer can be followed by which child-layer:

[cols=">1,<5"]
|===
| Layer | Child layer

| DRBD | CACHE, WRITECACHE, NVME, LUKS, STORAGE
| CACHE | WRITECACHE, NVME, LUKS, STORAGE
| WRITECACHE | CACHE, NVME, LUKS, STORAGE
| NVME | CACHE, WRITECACHE, LUKS, STORAGE
| LUKS | STORAGE
| STORAGE | -
|===

NOTE: One layer can only occur once in the layer list.

TIP: For information about the prerequisites for the `LUKS` layer, refer to the Encrypted
Volumes section of this User's Guide.

[[s-nvme-layer]]
==== NVMe-oF/NVMe-TCP LINSTOR Layer

NVMe-oF/NVMe-TCP allows LINSTOR to connect diskless resources to a node with the same resource
where the data is stored over NVMe fabrics. This leads to the advantage that resources can be
mounted without using local storage by accessing the data over the network. LINSTOR is not
using DRBD in this case, and therefore NVMe resources provisioned by LINSTOR are not replicated,
the data is stored on one node.

NOTE: NVMe-oF only works on RDMA-capable networks and NVMe-TCP on networks that can carry IP
traffic. You can use tools such as `lshw` or `ethtool` to verify the capabilities of your
network adapters.

To use NVMe-oF/NVMe-TCP with LINSTOR the package `nvme-cli` needs to be installed on every node
which acts as a satellite and will use NVMe-oF/NVMe-TCP for a resource. For example, on a
DEB-based system, to install the package, enter the following command:

----
# apt install nvme-cli
----

IMPORTANT: If you are not on a DEB-based system, use the suitable command for installing
packages on your operating system, for example, on SLES: `zypper`; on RPM-based systems: `dnf`.

To make a resource which uses NVMe-oF/NVMe-TCP an additional parameter has to be given as you
create the resource-definition:

----
# linstor resource-definition create nvmedata -l nvme,storage
----

NOTE: As default the -l (layer-stack) parameter is set to `drbd, storage` when DRBD is used. If
you want to create LINSTOR resources with neither NVMe nor DRBD you have to set the `-l`
parameter to only `storage`.

To use NVMe-TCP rather than the default NVMe-oF, the following property needs to be set:

----
# linstor resource-definition set-property nvmedata NVMe/TRType tcp
----

The property `NVMe/TRType` can alternatively be set on resource-group or controller level.

Next, create the volume-definition for your resource:

----
# linstor volume-definition create nvmedata 500G
----

Before you create the resource on your nodes you have to know where the data will be stored
locally and which node accesses it over the network.

First, create the resource on the node where your data will be stored:

----
# linstor resource create alpha nvmedata --storage-pool pool_ssd
----

On the nodes where the resource-data will be accessed over the network, the resource has to be
defined as diskless:

----
# linstor resource create beta nvmedata --nvme-initiator
----

Now you can mount the resource `nvmedata` on one of your nodes.

IMPORTANT: If your nodes have more than one NIC you should force the route between them for
NVMe-of/NVME-TCP, otherwise multiple NICs could cause troubles.

[[s-writecache-layer]]
==== Writecache Layer

A https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/writecache.html[DM-Writecache]
device is composed of two devices: one storage device and one cache device.
LINSTOR can setup such a writecache device, but needs some additional information, like
the storage pool and the size of the cache device.

----
# linstor storage-pool create lvm node1 lvmpool drbdpool
# linstor storage-pool create lvm node1 pmempool pmempool

# linstor resource-definition create r1
# linstor volume-definition create r1 100G

# linstor volume-definition set-property r1 0 Writecache/PoolName pmempool
# linstor volume-definition set-property r1 0 Writecache/Size 1%

# linstor resource create node1 r1 --storage-pool lvmpool --layer-list WRITECACHE,STORAGE
----

The two properties set in the examples are mandatory, but can also be set on controller level
which would act as a default for all resources with `WRITECACHE` in their `--layer-list`.
However, note that the `Writecache/PoolName` refers to the corresponding node. If the node does
not have a storage pool named `pmempool` you will get an error message.

The four mandatory parameters required by
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/writecache.html[DM-Writecache]
are either configured through a property or figured out by LINSTOR. The optional properties
listed in the mentioned link can also be set through a property. Refer to `linstor controller
set-property --help` for a list of `Writecache/*` property keys.

Using `--layer-list DRBD,WRITECACHE,STORAGE` while having DRBD configured to use external
metadata, only the backing device will use a writecache, not the device holding the external
metadata.

[[s-cache-layer]]
==== Cache Layer

LINSTOR can also setup a
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/cache.html[DM-Cache] device,
which is very similar to the DM-Writecache from the previous section. The major difference is
that a cache device is composed by three devices: one storage device, one cache device and one
meta device. The LINSTOR properties are quite similar to those of the writecache but are located
in the `Cache` namespace:

----
# linstor storage-pool create lvm node1 lvmpool drbdpool
# linstor storage-pool create lvm node1 pmempool pmempool

# linstor resource-definition create r1
# linstor volume-definition create r1 100G

# linstor volume-definition set-property r1 0 Cache/CachePool pmempool
# linstor volume-definition set-property r1 0 Cache/Cachesize 1%

# linstor resource create node1 r1 --storage-pool lvmpool --layer-list CACHE,STORAGE
----

NOTE: Rather than `Writecache/PoolName` (as when configuring the Writecache layer) the Cache
layer's only required property is called `Cache/CachePool`. The reason for this is that the
Cache layer also has a `Cache/MetaPool` which can be configured separately or it defaults to the
value of `Cache/CachePool`.

Refer to `linstor controller set-property --help` for a list of `Cache/*` property keys and
default values for omitted properties.

Using `--layer-list DRBD,CACHE,STORAGE` while having DRBD configured to use external metadata,
only the backing device will use a cache, not the device holding the external metadata.

[[s-storage-layer]]
==== Storage Layer

The storage layer will provide new devices from well known volume managers like LVM, ZFS or
others. Every layer combination needs to be based on a storage layer, even if the resource
should be diskless - for that type there is a dedicated `diskless` provider type.

For a list of providers with their properties refer to <<s-storage-providers, Storage Providers>>.

For some storage providers LINSTOR has special properties:

`StorDriver/WaitTimeoutAfterCreate`:: If LINSTOR expects a device to appear after creation
(for example after calls of `lvcreate`, `zfs create`,...), LINSTOR waits per default 500ms
for the device to appear. These 500ms can be overridden by this property.

`StorDriver/dm_stats`:: If set to `true` LINSTOR calls `dmstats create $device` after
creation and `dmstats delete $device --allregions` after deletion of a volume.
Currently only enabled for LVM and LVM_THIN storage providers.

[[s-storage-providers]]
=== Storage Providers

LINSTOR has a few storage providers. The most used ones are LVM and ZFS. But also for those
two providers there are already sub-types for their thin-provisioned variants.

* Diskless: This provider type is mostly required to have a storage pool that can be configured
  with LINSTOR properties like `PrefNic` as described in <<s-managing_network_interface_cards,
  Managing Network Interface Cards>>.

* LVM / LVM-Thin: The administrator is expected to specify the LVM volume group or the thin-pool
  (in form of "LV/thinpool") to use the corresponding storage type. These drivers support
  following properties for fine-tuning:

** `StorDriver/LvcreateOptions`: The value of this property is appended to every `lvcreate ...`
   call LINSTOR executes.

* ZFS / ZFS-Thin: The administrator is expected to specify the ZPool that LINSTOR should use.
  These drivers support following properties for fine-tuning:

** `StorDriver/ZfscreateOptions`: The value of this property is appended to every `zfs create
   ...` call LINSTOR executes.

* File / FileThin: Mostly used for demonstration or experiments. LINSTOR will reserve a file in
  a given directory and will configure a https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/loop.4.html[loop
  device] on top of that file.

* Exos [DEPRECATED]: This special storage provider is currently required to be run on a "special
  satellite". Refer to the <<ch-exos, EXOS Integration>> chapter.

* SPDK: The administrator is expected to specify the logical volume store which LINSTOR should
  use. The usage of this storage provider implies the usage of the <<s-nvme-layer,NVME Layer>>.

** Remote-SPDK: This special storage provider currently requires to be run on a "special
   satellite". Refer to <<s-remote-spdk, Remote SPDK Provider>> for more details.

[[s-linstor-storage-providers-storage-pool-mixing]]
==== Mixing Storage Pools of Different Storage Providers

While LINSTOR resources are most often backed by storage pools that consist of only one <<s-storage-providers,storage provider>> type, it is possible to user storage pools of different types to back a LINSTOR resource.
This is called mixing storage pools.
This might be useful when migrating storage resources but could also have some consequences.
Read this section carefully before configuring mixed storage pools. 

[[s-linstor-storage-providers-storage-pool-mixing-prereqs]]
===== Prerequisites For Mixing Storage Pools

Mixing storage pools has the following prerequisites:

- LINSTOR version 1.27.0 or later
- LINSTOR satellite nodes need to have DRBD version 9.2.7 (or 9.1.18 if on the 9.1 branch) or later
- The LINSTOR property `AllowMixingStoragePoolDriver` set to `true` on the LINSTOR controller, resource group, or resource definition LINSTOR object level

NOTE: Because of LINSTOR object hierarchy, if you set the `AllowMixingStoragePoolDriver` property on the LINSTOR controller object (`linstor controller set-property AllowMixingStoragePoolDriver true`), the property will apply to all LINSTOR resources, except for any resource groups or resource definitions where you have set the property to `false`. 

[[s-linstor-storage-providers-storage-pool-mixing-criteria]]
===== When Storage Pools Are Considered Mixed

If one of following criteria is met, LINSTOR will consider the setup as storage pool mixing:

1. The storage pools have different extent sizes.
For example, by default LVM has a 4MiB extent size while ZFS (since version 2.2.0) has a 16KiB extent size.

2. The storage pools have different DRBD initial synchronization strategies, for example, a full initial synchronization, or a day 0 based partial synchronization.
Using `zfs` and `zfthin` storage provider-backed storage pools together would not meet this criterion because they each use an initial day 0-based partial DRBD synchronization strategy.

[[s-linstor-storage-providers-storage-pool-mixing-consequences]]
===== Consequences of Mixing Storage Pools

When you create a LINSTOR resource that is backed by mixing storage pools, there might be consequences that affect LINSTOR features.
For example, when you mix `lvm` and `lvmthin` storage pools, any resource backed by such a mix will be considered a thick resource.
This is the mechanism by which LINSTOR allows for storage pool mixing.

An exception to this is the previously mentioned example of using `zfs` and `zfsthin` storage pools.
LINSTOR does not consider this mixing storage pools because combining a `zfs` and a `zfsthin` storage pool does not meet either of the two storage pool mixing criteria described earlier.
This is because the two storage pools will have the same extent size, and both storage pools will use the same DRBD initial synchronization strategy: day 0-based partial synchronization.

[[s-remote-spdk]]
==== Remote SPDK Provider

A storage pool with the type remote SPDK can only be created on a "special satellite". For this
you first need to start a new satellite using the command:

----
$ linstor node create-remote-spdk-target nodeName 192.168.1.110
----

This will start a new satellite instance running on the same machine as the controller. This
special satellite will do all the REST based RPC communication towards the remote SPDK proxy. As
the help message of the LINSTOR command shows, the administrator might want to use additional
settings when creating this special satellite:

----
$ linstor node create-remote-spdk-target -h
usage: linstor node create-remote-spdk-target [-h] [--api-port API_PORT]
                                              [--api-user API_USER]
                                              [--api-user-env API_USER_ENV]
                                              [--api-pw [API_PW]]
                                              [--api-pw-env API_PW_ENV]
                                              node_name api_host
----

The difference between the `--api-\*` and their corresponding `--api-\*-env` versions is that
the version with the `-env` ending will look for an environment variable containing the actual
value to use whereas the `--api-\*` version directly take the value which is stored in the
LINSTOR property. Administrators might not want to save the `--api-pw` in plain text, which
would be clearly visible using commands like `linstor node list-property <nodeName>`.

Once that special satellite is up and running the actual storage pool can be created:

----
$ linstor storage-pool create remotespdk -h
usage: linstor storage-pool create remotespdk [-h]
                                              [--shared-space SHARED_SPACE]
                                              [--external-locking]
                                              node_name name driver_pool_name
----

Whereas `node_name` is self-explanatory, `name` is the name of the LINSTOR storage pool and
`driver_pool_name` refers to the SPDK logical volume store.

Once this `remotespdk` storage pool is created the remaining procedure is quite similar as
using NVMe: First the target has to be created by creating a simple "diskful" resource followed
by a second resource having the `--nvme-initiator` option enabled.

[[s-managing_network_interface_cards]]
=== Managing Network Interface Cards

LINSTOR can deal with multiple network interface cards (NICs) in a machine. They are called
"net interfaces" in LINSTOR speak.

NOTE: When a satellite node is created a first net interface gets created implicitly with the
name `default`. You can use the `--interface-name` option of the `node create` command to give
it a different name, when you create the satellite node.

For existing nodes, additional net interfaces are created like this:

----
# linstor node interface create node-0 10G_nic 192.168.43.231
----

Net interfaces are identified by the IP address only, the name is arbitrary and is *not* related
to the NIC name used by Linux. You can then assign the net interface to a node so that the
node's DRBD traffic will be routed through the corresponding NIC.

----
# linstor node set-property node-0 PrefNic 10G_nic
----

NOTE: It is also possible to set the `PrefNic` property on a storage pool. DRBD traffic from
resources using the storage pool will be routed through the corresponding NIC. However, you need
to be careful here. Any DRBD resource that requires Diskless storage, for example, diskless
storage acting in a tiebreaker role for DRBD quorum purposes, will go through the default
satellite node net interface, until you also set the `PrefNic` property for the `default` net
interface. Setups can become complex. It is far easier and safer, if you can get away with it,
to set the `PrefNic` property at the node level. This way, all storage pools on the node,
including Diskless storage pools, will use your preferred NIC.

If you need to add an interface for only controller-satellite traffic, you can add an
interface using the above `node interface create` command. Then you modify the connection to
make it the active controller-satellite connection. For example, if you added an interface named
`1G-satconn` on all nodes, after adding the interface, you can then tell LINSTOR to use this
interface for controller-satellite traffic by entering the following command:

----
# linstor node interface modify node-0 1G-satconn --active
----

You can verify this change by using the `linstor node interface list node-0` command. Output
from the command should show that the `StltCon` label applies to the `1G-satconn` interface.

While this method routes DRBD traffic through a specified NIC, it is not possible through
`linstor` commands only, to route LINSTOR controller-client traffic through a specific NIC, for
example, commands that you issue from a LINSTOR client to the controller. To achieve this, you
can either:

* Specify a LINSTOR controller by using methods outlined in <<s-using_the_linstor_client>> *and*
have the only route to the controller as specified be through the NIC that you want to use for
controller-client traffic.

* Use Linux tools such as `ip route` and `iptables` to filter LINSTOR client-controller traffic,
port number 3370, and route it through a specific NIC.

[[s-creating-multiple-drbd-paths]]
==== Creating Multiple DRBD Paths with LINSTOR

To use
https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/drbd-guide-9_0-en/#s-configuring-multiple-paths[multiple
network paths] for DRBD setups, the `PrefNic` property is not sufficient. Instead the `linstor
node interface` and `linstor resource-connection path` commands should be used, as shown below.

----
# linstor node interface create alpha nic1 192.168.43.221
# linstor node interface create alpha nic2 192.168.44.221
# linstor node interface create bravo nic1 192.168.43.222
# linstor node interface create bravo nic2 192.168.44.222

# linstor resource-connection path create alpha bravo myResource path1 nic1 nic1
# linstor resource-connection path create alpha bravo myResource path2 nic2 nic2
----

The first four commands in the example define a network interface (`nic1` and `nic2`) for each
node (`alpha` and `bravo`) by specifying the network interface's IP address. The last two
commands create network path entries in the DRBD `.res` file that LINSTOR generates. This is the
relevant part of the resulting `.res` file:

----
resource myResource {
  ...
  connection {
    path {
      host alpha address 192.168.43.221:7000;
      host bravo address 192.168.43.222:7000;
    }
    path {
      host alpha address 192.168.44.221:7000;
      host bravo address 192.168.44.222:7000;
    }
  }
}
----

NOTE: While it is possible to specify a port number to be used for LINSTOR satellite traffic
when creating a node interface, this port number is ignored when creating a DRBD resource
connection path. Instead, the command will assign a port number dynamically, starting from port
number 7000 and incrementing up.

[[s-linstor-effects-of-new-paths-on-default-path]]
===== How Adding a New DRBD Path Affects the Default Path

The NIC that is first in order on a LINSTOR satellite node is named the `default` net interface.
DRBD traffic traveling between two nodes that do not have an explicitly configured resource
connection path will take an implicit path that uses the two nodes' `default` net interfaces.

When you add a resource connection path between two nodes for a DRBD-backed resource, DRBD
traffic between the two nodes will use this new path only, although a `default` network
interface will still exist on each node. This can be significant if your new path uses different
NICs than the implicit default path.

To use the default path again, in addition to any new paths, you will need to explicitly add it.
For example:

----
# linstor resource-connection path create alpha bravo myResource path3 default default
----

Although the newly created `path3` uses net interfaces that are named `default` on the two
nodes, the path itself is not a default path because other paths exist, namely `path1` and
`path2`. The new path, `path3`, will just act as a third possible path, and DRBD traffic and
path selection behavior will be as described in the next section.

===== Multiple DRBD Paths Behavior

The behavior of a multiple DRBD paths configuration will be different depending on the DRBD
transport type. From the DRBD User's
Guidefootnote:[https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/drbd-guide-9_0-en/#s-configuring-multiple-paths]:

"The TCP transport uses one path at a time. If the backing TCP connections get dropped, or show
timeouts, the TCP transport implementation tries to establish a connection over the next path.
It goes over all paths in a round-robin fashion until a connection gets established.

"The RDMA transport uses all paths of a connection concurrently and it balances the network
traffic between the paths evenly."

// if customers request, we should be able to also extend this to `node-connection` level

[[s-linstor-encrypted-volumes]]
=== Encrypted Volumes

LINSTOR can handle transparent encryption of DRBD volumes. dm-crypt is used to
encrypt the provided storage from the storage device.

NOTE: To use dm-crypt, verify that `cryptsetup` is installed before
you start the satellite.

Basic steps to use encryption:

. Create a master passphrase
. Add `luks` to the layer-list. Note that all plugins (e.g., Proxmox) require a DRBD layer as the top most layer if they do not explicitly state otherwise.
. Don't forget to re-enter the master passphrase after a controller restart.

[[s-encrypt_commands]]
==== Encryption Commands
Below are details about the commands.

Before LINSTOR can encrypt any volume a master passphrase needs to be created.
This can be done with the LINSTOR client.

----
# linstor encryption create-passphrase
----

`crypt-create-passphrase` will wait for the user to input the initial master passphrase
(as all other crypt commands will with no arguments).

If you ever want to change the master passphrase this can be done with:

----
# linstor encryption modify-passphrase
----

The `luks` layer can be added when creating the resource-definition or the resource
itself, whereas the former method is recommended since it will be automatically applied
to all resource created from that resource-definition.

----
# linstor resource-definition create crypt_rsc --layer-list luks,storage
----

To enter the master passphrase (after controller restart) use the following command:

----
# linstor encryption enter-passphrase
----

NOTE: Whenever the linstor-controller is restarted, the user has to send
the master passphrase to the controller, otherwise LINSTOR is unable to reopen or
create encrypted volumes.

[[s-automatic_passphrase]]
==== Automatic Passphrase
It is possible to automate the process of creating and re-entering the master passphrase.

To use this, either an environment variable called `MASTER_PASSPHRASE` or an entry in
`/etc/linstor/linstor.toml` containing the master passphrase has to be created.

The required `linstor.toml` looks like this:

----
[encrypt]
passphrase="example"
----

If either one of these is set, then every time the controller starts it will check whether a
master passphrase already exists. If there is none, it will create a new master passphrase as
specified. Otherwise, the controller enters the passphrase.

WARNING: If a master passphrase is already configured, and it is not the same one as specified
in the environment variable or `linstor.toml`, the controller will be unable to re-enter the
master passphrase and react as if the user had entered a wrong passphrase. This can only be
resolved through manual input from the user, using the same commands as if the controller was
started without the automatic passphrase.

NOTE: In case the master passphrase is set in both an environment variable and the
`linstor.toml`, only the master passphrase from the `linstor.toml` will be used.

[[s-linstor-status]]
=== Checking Cluster State

LINSTOR provides various commands to check the state of your cluster. These commands start with
a 'list' precursor, after which, various filtering and sorting options can be used. The
'--groupby' option can be used to group and sort the output in multiple dimensions.

[[s-linstor-node-evacuate]]
=== Evacuating a Node

You can use the LINSTOR command `node evacuate` to evacuate a node of its resources, for
example, if you are preparing to delete a node from your cluster, and you need the node's
resources moved to other nodes in the cluster. After successfully evacuating a node, the node's
LINSTOR status will show as "EVACUATE" rather than "Online", and it will have no LINSTOR
resources on it.

IMPORTANT: If you are evacuating a node where LINSTOR is deployed within another environment,
such as Kubernetes, or OpenNebula, you need to move the node's LINSTOR-backed workload to
another node in your cluster before evacuating its resources. For special actions and
considerations within a Kubernetes environment, see the <<s-kubernetes-evacuate-node>> section.
For a LINSTOR node in OpenNebula, you need to perform a <<s-opennebula-linstor-live-migration,
live migration>> of the OpenNebula LINSTOR-backed virtual machines that your node hosts, to
another node in your cluster, before evacuating the node's resources.

Evacuate a node using the following steps:

. Determine if any resources on the node that you want to evacuate are "InUse". The "InUse"
status corresponds to a resource being in a DRBD _Primary_ state. Before you can evacuate a node
successfully, none of the resources on the node should be "InUse", otherwise LINSTOR will fail
to remove the "InUse" resources from the node as part of the evacuation process.

. Run `linstor node evacuate <node_name>`. You will get a warning if there is no suitable
replacement node for a resource on the evacuating node. For example, if you have three nodes and
you want to evacuate one, but your resource group sets a placement count of three, you will get
a warning that will prevent the node from removing the resources from the evacuating node.

. Verify that the status of `linstor node list` for your node is "EVACUATE" rather than
"Online".

. Check the "State" status of resources on your node, by using the `linstor resource list`
command. You should see syncing activity that will last for sometime, depending on the size of
the data sets in your node's resources.

. List the remaining resources on the node by using the command `linstor resource list --nodes
<node_name>`. If any are left, verify whether they are just waiting for the sync to complete.

. Verify that there are no resources on the node, by using the `linstor resource list` command.

. Remove the node from the cluster by using the command `linstor node delete <node_name>`.

[[s-linstor-evacuating-multiple-nodes]]
==== Evacuating Multiple Nodes

Some evacuation cases might need special planning. For example, if you are evacuating more than
one node, you can exclude the nodes from participating in LINSTOR's resource autoplacer. You can
do this by using the following command on each node that you want to evacuate:

----
# linstor node set-property <node_name> AutoplaceTarget false
----

This ensures that LINSTOR will not place resources from a node that you are evacuating onto
another node that you plan on evacuating.

[[s-linstor-removing-node-evacuating-state]]
==== Restoring an Evacuating Node

If you already ran a `node evacuate` command that has either completed or still has resources in
an "Evacuating" state, you can remove the "Evacuating" state from a node by using the `node
restore` command. This will work if you have not yet run a `node delete` command.

After restoring the node, you should use the `node set-property <node_name> AutoplaceTarget
true` command, if you previously set the `AutoplaceTarget` property to "false". This way,
LINSTOR can again place resources onto the node automatically, to fulfill placement count
properties that you might have set for resources in your cluster.

IMPORTANT: If LINSTOR has already evacuated resources when running a `node restore` command,
evacuated resources will not automatically return to the node. If LINSTOR is still in the
process of evacuating resources, this process will continue until LINSTOR has placed the
resources on other nodes. You will need to manually "move" the resources that were formerly on
the restored node. You can do this by first creating the resources on the restored node and then
deleting the resources from another node where LINSTOR might have placed them. You can use the
`resource list` command to show you on which nodes your resources are placed.

[[s-linstor-snapshots]]
=== Working With Resource Snapshots and Backups

LINSTOR supports taking snapshots of resources that are backed by thin LVM or ZFS storage pools. By creating and shipping snapshots, you can back up LINSTOR resources to other storage: either to S3 storage or to storage in another (or the same!) LINSTOR cluster. The following sub-sections describe various aspects of working with snapshots and backups.

[[s-linstor-snapshots-creating]]
==== Creating a Snapshot

Assuming a resource definition named 'resource1' which has been placed on some nodes, you can
create a snapshot of the resource by entering the following command:

----
# linstor snapshot create resource1 snap1
----

This will create a snapshot on all nodes where the resource is present. LINSTOR will create
consistent snapshots, even when the resource is in active use.

Setting the resource definition property `AutoSnapshot/RunEvery` LINSTOR will automatically
create snapshots every X minutes. The optional property `AutoSnapshot/Keep` can be used to
clean up old snapshots which were created automatically. No manually created snapshot will be
cleaned up or deleted. If `AutoSnapshot/Keep` is omitted (or <= 0), LINSTOR will keep the last
10 snapshots by default.

----
# linstor resource-definition set-property AutoSnapshot/RunEvery 15
# linstor resource-definition set-property AutoSnapshot/Keep 5
----

[[s-linstor-snapshots-restoring]]
==== Restoring a Snapshot

The following steps restore a snapshot to a new resource. This is possible even when the
original resource has been removed from the nodes where the snapshots were taken.

First define the new resource with volumes matching those from the snapshot:

----
# linstor resource-definition create resource2
# linstor snapshot volume-definition restore --from-resource resource1 \
  --from-snapshot snap1 --to-resource resource2
----

At this point, additional configuration can be applied if necessary. Then, when ready, create
resources based on the snapshots:

----
# linstor snapshot resource restore --from-resource resource1 \
  --from-snapshot snap1 --to-resource resource2
----

This will place the new resource on all nodes where the snapshot is present. The nodes on which
to place the resource can also be selected explicitly; see the help (`linstor snapshot resource
restore --help`).

[[s-linstor-snapshots-rolling-back]]
==== Rolling Back to a Snapshot

LINSTOR can roll a resource back to a snapshot state. The resource must not be in use. That
is, the resource must not be mounted on any nodes. If the resource is in use, consider whether
you can achieve your goal by <<s-linstor-snapshots-restoring,restoring the snapshot>> instead.

Rollback is performed as follows:

----
# linstor snapshot rollback resource1 snap1
----

A resource can only be rolled back to the most recent snapshot. To roll back to an older
snapshot, first delete the intermediate snapshots.

[[s-linstor-snapshots-removing-a-snapshot]]
==== Removing a Snapshot

An existing snapshot can be removed as follows:

----
# linstor snapshot delete resource1 snap1
----

[[s-linstor-snapshots-shipping]]
=== Shipping Snapshots

Snapshots can be shipped between nodes in the same LINSTOR cluster, between different LINSTOR
clusters, or to S3 storage such as https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3] or
https://min.io/[min.io].

The following tools need to be installed on the satellites that are going to send or receive
snapshots:

* `zstd` is needed to compress the data before it is being shipped

* `thin-send-recv` is needed to ship data when using LVM thin-provisioned volumes

IMPORTANT: You need to restart the satellite node (or nodes) after installing these tools,
otherwise LINSTOR will not be able to use them.

[[s-linstor-snapshots-working-with-remotes]]
==== Working With Snapshot Shipping Remotes

In a LINSTOR cluster, a snapshot shipping target is called a remote. Currently, there are two
different types of remotes that you can use when shipping snapshots: LINSTOR remotes and S3
remotes. LINSTOR remotes are used to ship snapshots to a different LINSTOR cluster or within
the same LINSTOR cluster. S3 remotes are used to ship snapshots to AWS S3, min.io or any other
service using S3 compatible object storage. A shipped snapshot on a remote is also called a
backup.

IMPORTANT: Since a remote needs to store sensitive data, such as passwords, it is necessary to
have encryption enabled whenever you want to use a remote in any way. How to set up LINSTOR's
encryption is described <<s-encrypt_commands,here>>.

[[s-linstor-snapshots-creating-an-s3-remote]]
===== Creating an S3 Remote

To create an S3 remote, LINSTOR will need to know the endpoint (that is, the URL of the target
S3 server), the name of the target bucket, the region the S3 server is in, and the access-key
and secret-key used to access the bucket. If the command is sent without adding the secret-key,
a prompt will pop up to enter it in. The command should look like this:

----
# linstor remote create s3 myRemote s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com \
  my-bucket us-west-2 admin password
----

TIP: Usually, LINSTOR uses the endpoint and bucket to create an URL using the
virtual-hosted-style for its access to the given bucket (for example
my-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com). Should your setup not allow access this way, change the
remote to path-style access (for example `s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-bucket`) by adding the
`--use-path-style` argument to make LINSTOR combine the parameters accordingly.

[[s-linstor-snapshots-creating-a-linstor-remote]]
===== Creating a LINSTOR Remote

To create a LINSTOR remote, you only need to specify a name for the remote and the URL or IP
address of the controller of the target cluster. An example command is as follows:

----
# linstor remote create linstor myRemote 192.168.0.15
----

To ship a snapshot between two LINSTOR clusters, or within the same LINSTOR cluster, besides
creating a remote on the source cluster that points to the target cluster, on the target
cluster, you also need to create a LINSTOR remote that points to the source cluster. This is to
prevent your target cluster from accepting backup shipments from unknown sources. You can create
such a remote on your target cluster by specifying the cluster ID of the source cluster in an
additional argument to the `remote create` command. Refer to
<<s-linstor-resource-backup-shipping-l2l,>> for details.

[[s-shipping-snapshots-remote-listing]]
===== Listing, Modifying, and Deleting Remotes

To see all the remotes known to the local cluster, use `linstor remote list`. To delete a
remote, use `linstor remote delete myRemoteName`. If you need to modify an existing remote, use
`linstor remote modify` to change it.

[[s-linstor-snapshots-remote-passphrase]]
===== Specifying a LINSTOR Passphrase When Creating a Remote

When the snapshot that you want to ship contains a LUKS layer, the remote on the target cluster
also needs the passphrase of the source cluster set when you create the remote. This is because
the LINSTOR passphrase is used to encrypt the LUKS passphrase. To specify the source cluster's
LINSTOR passphrase when you create a LINSTOR remote on the target cluster, enter:

----
$ linstor --controllers <TARGET_CONTROLLER> remote create linstor \
--cluster-id <SOURCE_CLUSTER_ID> --passphrase <SOURCE_CONTROLLER_PASSPHRASE> <NAME> <URL>
----

For LINSTOR to LINSTOR snapshot shipping, you must also create a LINSTOR remote on the source
cluster. For simplicity sake, although not strictly necessary, you can specify the target
cluster's LINSTOR passphrase when you create a LINSTOR remote for the target cluster on the
source cluster, before you ship backups or snapshots. On the source cluster, enter:

----
$ linstor --controllers <SOURCE_CONTROLLER> remote create linstor \
--cluster-id <TARGET_CLUSTER_ID> --passphrase <TARGET_CONTROLLER_PASSPHRASE> <NAME> <URL>
----

NOTE: If you are specifying a LINSTOR controller node (perhaps because you have a
<<s-linstor_ha, highly available controller>>), when creating a remote, you can specify the
controller either by an IP address or a resolvable hostname.

[[s-linstor-snapshots-shipping-to-an-s3-remote]]
==== Shipping Snapshots to an S3 Remote

To ship a snapshot to an S3 remote, that is, to create a backup of a resource on an S3 remote,
all you need to do is to specify an S3 remote that the current cluster can reach and then
specify the resource that should be shipped. The following command will create a snapshot of a
resource, `myRsc`, and ship it to the given S3 remote, `myRemote`:

----
# linstor backup create myRemote myRsc
----

If this isn't the first time you shipped a backup of this resource (to that remote) and the
snapshot of the previous backup hasn't been deleted yet, an incremental backup will be shipped.
To force the creation of a full backup, add the `--full` argument to the command. Getting a
specific node to ship the backup is also possible by using `--node myNode`, but if the specified
node is not available or only has the resource diskless, a different node will be chosen.

[[s-linstor-snapshots-shipping-to-a-linstor-remote]]
==== Shipping Snapshots to a LINSTOR Remote

You can ship a snapshot between two LINSTOR clusters by
<<s-linstor-snapshots-creating-a-linstor-remote,specifying a LINSTOR remote>>. Snapshot shipping
to a LINSTOR remote also requires at least one diskful resource on the source side (where you
issue the shipping command).

[[s-shipping-snapshots-l2l-creating-remote]]
===== Creating a Remote for a LINSTOR Target Cluster

Before you can ship a snapshot to a LINSTOR target cluster, on the target side, you need to
<<s-linstor-snapshots-creating-a-linstor-remote,create a LINSTOR remote>> and specify the
cluster ID of the source cluster as the remote:

----
$ linstor remote create linstor --cluster-id <SOURCE_CLUSTER_ID> <NAME> <URL>
----

IMPORTANT: If you do not specify the cluster ID of your source cluster when you create a LINSTOR
remote on your target cluster, you will receive an "Unknown Cluster" error when you try to ship
a backup. To get the cluster ID of your source cluster, you can enter the command `linstor
controller list-properties|grep -i cluster` from the source cluster.

IMPORTANT: If you might be creating and shipping snapshots of resources that have a LUKS layer,
then you also need to specify a passphrase when creating a remote, as described in the
<<s-linstor-snapshots-remote-passphrase,>> section.

In the `remote create` command shown above, `<NAME>` is an arbitrary name that you specify to
identify the remote. `<URL>` is either the IP address of the source (remote) LINSTOR controller
or its resolvable hostname. If you have configured a highly available LINSTOR controller, use
its virtual IP address (VIP) or the VIP's resolvable name.

[[s-linstor-resource-backup-shipping-l2l]]
===== Shipping a Snapshot of a Resource to a LINSTOR Remote

To create a snapshot of a resource from your source LINSTOR cluster and ship it to your target
LINSTOR cluster, enter the following command:

----
# linstor backup ship myRemote localRsc targetRsc
----

This command essentially creates a backup of your local resource on your target LINSTOR remote.

Additionally, you can use `--source-node` to specify which node should send and `--target-node`
to specify which node should receive the backup. In case those nodes are not available, the
LINSTOR controller will choose different nodes automatically.

IMPORTANT: If `targetRsc` is already a deployed resource on the remote cluster, snapshots in the
backup shipping for `localRsc` will ship to the remote cluster but they will not be restored to
the remote cluster. The same is true if you specify the `--download-only` option with the
`linstor backup ship` command.

[[s-linstor-snapshot-shipping-within-a-single-cluster]]
==== Snapshot Shipping Within a Single LINSTOR Cluster

If you want to ship a snapshot inside the same cluster, you just need to create a LINSTOR remote
that points to the local controller. To do this if you are logged into your LINSTOR controller,
for example, enter the following command:

----
# linstor remote create linstor --cluster-id <CLUSTER_ID> <NAME> localhost
----

You can then follow the instructions to <<s-linstor-resource-backup-shipping-l2l,ship a snapshot
to a LINSTOR remote>>.

[[s-shipping_snapshots-backups-listing]]
==== Listing Backups on a Remote

To show which backups exist on a specific S3 remote, use `linstor backup list myS3Remote`. A
resource-name can be added to the command as a filter to only show backups of that specific
resource by using the argument `--resource myRsc`. If you use the `--other` argument, only
entries in the bucket that LINSTOR does not recognize as a backup will be shown. LINSTOR always
names backups in a certain way, and if an item in the remote is named according to this schema,
it is assumed that it is a backup created by LINSTOR - so this list will show everything else.

To show which backups exist on a LINSTOR remote, use the `linstor snapshot list` command on your
LINSTOR target cluster.

[[s-shipping_snapshots-backups-deleting]]
==== Deleting Backups on a Remote

There are several options when it comes to deleting backups:

* `linstor backup delete all myRemote`: This command deletes ALL S3-objects on the given remote,
provided that they are recognized to be backups, that is, fit the expected naming schema. There
is the option `--cluster` to only delete backups that were created by the current cluster.

* `linstor backup delete id myRemote my-rsc_back_20210824_072543`: This command deletes a single
backup from the given remote - namely the one with the given id, which consists of the
resource-name, the automatically generated snapshot-name (`back_timestamp`) and, if set, the
`backup-suffix`. The option `--prefix` lets you delete all backups starting with the given id.
The option `--cascade` deletes not only the specified backup, but all other incremental backups
depending on it.

* `linstor backup delete filter myRemote ...`: This command has a few different arguments to
specify a selection of backups to delete. `-t 20210914_120000` will delete all backups made
before 12 o'clock on the 14th of September, 2021. `-n myNode` will delete all backups uploaded
by the given node. `-r myRsc` will delete all backups with the given resource name. These
filters can be combined as needed. Finally, `--cascade` deletes not only the selected backup(s),
but all other incremental backups depending on any of the selected backups.

* `linstor backup delete s3key myRemote randomPictureInWrongBucket`: This command will find the
object with the given S3-key and delete it - without considering anything else. This should only
be used to either delete non-backup items from the remote, or to clean up a broken backup that
you are no longer able to delete by other means. Using this command to delete a regular, working
backup will break that backup, so beware!

WARNING: All commands that have the `--cascade` option will NOT delete a backup that has
incremental backups depending on it unless you explicitly add that option.

TIP: All `linstor backup delete ...` commands have the `--dry-run` option, which will give you a
list of all the S3-objects that will be deleted. This can be used to ensure nothing that should
not be deleted is accidentally deleted.

[[s-shipping_snapshots-backups-restoring]]
==== Restoring Backups From a Remote

Maybe the most important task after creating a backup is restoring it. To restore a backup from
an S3 remote, you can use the `linstor backup restore` command.

With this command, you specify the name of the S3 remote to restore a backup from, the name of
the target node, and a target resource to restore to on the node. If the resource name does not
match an existing resource definition, LINSTOR will create the resource definition and resource.

Additionally, you need to specify the name of the resource on the remote that has the backup.
You do this by using either the `--resource` or `--id` arguments but not both.

By using the `--resource` option, you can restore the latest backup of the resource that you
specify, for example:

----
# linstor backup restore myRemote myNode targetRsc --resource sourceRsc
----

By using the `--id` option, you can restore the exact backup that you specify, for example, to
restore a backup of a resource other than the most recent. To get backup IDs, refer to
<<s-shipping_snapshots-backups-listing>>.

----
# linstor backup restore myRemote myNode targetRsc --id sourceRsc_back_20210824_072543
----

NOTE: When shipping a snapshot to a LINSTOR (not S3) remote, the snapshot is restored
immediately to the specified resource on the target (remote) cluster, unless you use the
`--download-only` option or else if the target resource has at least one replica.

When you restore a backup to a resource, LINSTOR will download all the snapshots from the last
full backup of the resource, up to the backup that you specified (when using the `--id` option)
or up to the latest backup (when using the `--resource` option). After downloading these
snapshots, LINSTOR restores the snapshots into a new resource. You can skip restoring the
snapshots into a new resources by adding the `--download-only` option to your `backup restore`
command.

LINSTOR can download backups to restore from any cluster, not just the one that uploaded them,
provided that the setup is correct. Specifically, the target resource cannot have any existing
resources or snapshots, and the storage pool(s) used need to have the same storage providers. If
the storage pool(s) on the target node has the exact same name(s) as on the cluster the backup
was created on, no extra action is necessary. If the nodes have different storage pool names,
then you need to use the `--storpool-rename` option with your `backup restore` command. This
option expects at least one `oldname=newname` pair. For every storage pool of the original
backup that is not named in that list, LINSTOR assumes that the storage pool name is exactly the
same on the target node.

To find out exactly which storage pools you will need rename, and how big the download and the
restored resource will be, you can use the command `linstor backup info myRemote ...`. Similar
to the restore command, you need to specify either the `--resource` or `--id` option. When used
with the `backup info` command, these options have the same restrictions as when used with the
`backup restore` command. To show how much space will be left over in the local storage pools
after a restore, you can add the argument `-n myNode`. The same as with an actual restore
operation, the `backup info` command assumes that the storage pool names are exactly the same on
the target and source nodes. If that is not the case, you can use the `--storpool-rename`
option, just as with the restore command.

[[s-shipping_snapshots-backups-restoring-with-luks-layer]]
===== Restoring Backups That Have a LUKS Layer

If the backup to be restored includes a LUKS layer, the `--passphrase` argument is required.
With it, the passphrase of the original cluster of the backup needs to be set so that LINSTOR
can decrypt the volumes after download and re-encrypt them with the local passphrase.

[[s-shipping_snapshots-concurrently]]
===== Controlling How Many Shipments Are Active at the Same Time

There might be cases where an automated task (be it LINSTOR's scheduled shipping or an external
tool) starts too many shipments at once, leading to an overload of the network or some of the
nodes sending the backups.

In a case such as this, the solution is to reduce the amount of shipments that can happen at the
same time on the same node. This is done by using the property
`BackupShipping/MaxConcurrentBackupsPerNode`. This property can be set either on the controller
or on a specific node.

The expected value for this property is a number. Setting it to any negative number will be
interpreted as "no limit", while setting it to zero will result in this specific node not being
eligible to ship any backups - or completely disabling backup shipping if the property is set to
0 on the controller.

Any other positive number is treated as a limit of concurrently active shipments per node. To
determine which node will send a backup shipment, LINSTOR uses the following logic in the order
shown:

1. The node specified in the command (`--source-node` for shipping to another LINSTOR cluster,
`--node` for shipping to S3 compatible storage) will ship the backup.

2. The node that has the most available backup slots will ship the backup.

3. If no node has an available backup slot, the shipment will be added to a queue and started as
soon as a different shipment has finished which leads to a backup slot becoming available.

[[s-shipping_snapshots-old]]
===== Shipping a Snapshot in the Same Cluster

Before you can ship a snapshot to a different node within the same LINSTOR cluster, you need to
create a LINSTOR remote object that specifies your LINSTOR cluster's ID. Refer to the
<<s-shipping_snapshots-l2l>> section for instructions on how to get your LINSTOR cluster's ID
and create such a remote. An example command would be:

----
# linstor remote create linstor self 127.0.0.1 --cluster-id <LINSTOR_CLUSTER_ID>
----

NOTE: `self` is a user-specified, arbitrary name for your LINSTOR remote. You can specify a
different name if you want.

Both, the source and the target node have to have the resource for snapshot shipping deployed.
Additionally, the target resource has to be deactivated.

----
# linstor resource deactivate nodeTarget resource1
----

WARNING: You cannot reactivate a resource with DRBD in its layer-list after deactivating such a
resource. However, a successfully shipped snapshot of a DRBD resource can still be
<<s-linstor-snapshots-restoring,restored into a new resource>>. To manually start the snapshot
shipping, use:

----
# linstor backup ship self localRsc targetRsc
----

WARNING: The `snapshot ship` command is considered deprecated and any bugs found with it will
not be fixed. Instead, to ship a snapshot in the same LINSTOR cluster, use the `backup ship`
command, as shown in the example above, with a remote pointing to your local controller. For
more details about configuring a LINSTOR cluster as a remote, see the
<<s-linstor-snapshots-shipping-to-a-linstor-remote>> section.

By default, the snapshot shipping feature uses TCP ports from the range 12000-12999. To change
this range, the property `SnapshotShipping/TcpPortRange`, which accepts a to-from range, can be
set on the controller:

----
# linstor controller set-property SnapshotShipping/TcpPortRange 10000-12000
----

A resource can also be periodically shipped. To accomplish this, it is mandatory to set the
properties `SnapshotShipping/TargetNode` and `SnapshotShipping/RunEvery` on the
resource-definition. `SnapshotShipping/SourceNode` can also be set, but if omitted LINSTOR will
choose an active resource of the same resource-definition.

To allow incremental snapshot-shipping, LINSTOR has to keep at least the last shipped snapshot
on the target node. The property `SnapshotShipping/Keep` can be used to specify how many
snapshots LINSTOR should keep. If the property is not set (or <= 0) LINSTOR will keep the last
10 shipped snapshots by default.

----
# linstor resource-definition set-property resource1 SnapshotShipping/TargetNode nodeTarget
# linstor resource-definition set-property resource1 SnapshotShipping/SourceNode nodeSource
# linstor resource-definition set-property resource1 SnapshotShipping/RunEvery 15
# linstor resource-definition set-property resource1 SnapshotShipping/Keep 5
----

[[s-linstor-scheduled-backup-shipping]]
=== Scheduled Backup Shipping

Starting with LINSTOR Controller version 1.19.0 and working with LINSTOR client version 1.14.0
or above, you can configure scheduled backup shipping for deployed LINSTOR resources.

Scheduled backup shipping consists of three parts:

- A data set that consists of one or more deployed LINSTOR resources that you want to backup and
  ship

- A remote destination to ship backups to (another LINSTOR cluster or an S3 instance)

- A schedule that defines when the backups should ship

IMPORTANT: LINSTOR backup shipping only works for deployed LINSTOR resources that are backed by
thin-provisioned LVM and ZFS storage pools, because these are the storage pool types with
snapshot support in LINSTOR.

[[s-linstor-creating-backup-shipping-schedule]]
==== Creating a Backup Shipping Schedule

You create a backup shipping schedule by using the LINSTOR client `schedule create` command and
defining the frequency of backup shipping using `cron` syntax. You also need to set options
that name the schedule and define various aspects of the backup shipping, such as on-failure
actions, the number of local and remote backup copies to keep, and whether to also schedule
incremental backup shipping.

At a minimum, the command needs a schedule name and a full backup cron schema to create a backup
shipping schedule. An example command would look like this:

----
# linstor schedule create \
  --incremental-cron '* * * * *' \ <1>
  --keep-local 5 \ <2>
  --keep-remote 4 \ <3>
  --on-failure RETRY \ <4>
  --max-retries 10 \ <5>
  <schedule_name> \ <6>
  '* * * * *' # full backup cron schema <7>
----

IMPORTANT: Enclose cron schemas within single or double quotation marks.

<1> If specified, the incremental cron schema describes how frequently to create and ship
incremental backups. New incremental backups are based on the most recent full backup.
[OPTIONAL]

<2> The `--keep-local` option allows you to specify how many snapshots that a full backup is
based upon should be kept at the local backup source. If unspecified, all snapshots will be
kept. [OPTIONAL]

<3> The `--keep-remote` option allows you to specify how many full backups should be kept at the
remote destination. This option only works with S3 remote backup destinations, because you would
not want to allow a cluster node to delete backups from a node in another cluster. All
incremental backups based on a deleted full backup will also be deleted at the remote
destination. If unspecified, the `--keep-remote` option defaults to "all". [OPTIONAL]

<4> Specifies whether to "RETRY" or "SKIP" the scheduled backup shipping if it fails. If "SKIP"
is specified, LINSTOR will ignore the failure and continue with the next scheduled backup
shipping. If "RETRY" is specified, LINSTOR will wait 60 seconds and then try the backup shipping
again. The LINSTOR `schedule create` command defaults to "SKIP" if no `--on-failure` option is
given. [OPTIONAL]

<5> The number of times to retry the backup shipping if a scheduled backup shipping fails and
the `--on-failure RETRY` option has been given. Without this option, the LINSTOR controller will
retry the scheduled backup shipping indefinitely, until it is successful. [OPTIONAL]

<6> The name that you give the backup schedule so that you can reference it later with the
schedule list, modify, delete, enable, or disable commands. [REQUIRED]

<7> This cron schema describes how frequently LINSTOR creates snapshots and ships full backups.
[REQUIRED]

IMPORTANT: If you specify an incremental cron schema that has overlap with the full cron schema
that you specify, at the times when both types of backup shipping would occur simultaneously,
LINSTOR will only make and ship a full backup. For example, if you specify that a full backup be
made every three hours, and an incremental backup be made every hour, then every third hour,
LINSTOR will only make and ship a full backup. For this reason, specifying the same cron schema
for both your incremental and full backup shipping schedules would be useless, because
incremental backups will never be made.

[[s-linstor-modifying-backup-shipping-schedule]]
==== Modifying a Backup Shipping Schedule

You can modify a backup shipping schedule by using the LINSTOR client `schedule modify` command.
The syntax for the command is the same as that for the `schedule create` command. The name that
you specify with the `schedule modify` command must be an already existing backup schedule. Any
options to the command that you do not specify will retain their existing values. If you want to
set the `keep-local` or `keep-remote` options back to their default values, you can set them to
"all". If you want to set the `max-retries` option to its default value, you can set it to
"forever".

==== Configuring the Number of Local Snapshots and Remote Backups to Keep

Your physical storage is not infinite and your remote storage has a cost, so you will likely
want to set limits on the number of snapshots and backups you keep.

Both the `--keep-remote` and `--keep-local` options deserve special mention as they have
implications beyond what might be obvious. Using these options, you specify how many snapshots or
full backups should be kept, either on the local source or the remote destination.

[[s-linstor-configuring-backup-shipping-schedule-keep-local]]
===== Configuring the Keep-Local Option

For example, if a `--keep-local=2` option is set, then the backup shipping schedule, on first
run, will make a snapshot for a full backup. On the next scheduled full backup shipping, it will
make a second snapshot for a full backup. On the next scheduled full backup shipping, it makes a
third snapshot for a full backup. This time, however, after successful completion, LINSTOR
deletes the first (oldest) full backup shipping snapshot. If snapshots were made for any
incremental backups based on this full snapshot, they will also be deleted from the local source
node. On the next successful full backup shipping, LINSTOR will delete the second full backup
snapshot and any incremental snapshots based upon it, and so on, with each successive backup
shipping.

NOTE: If there are local snapshots remaining from failed shipments, these will be deleted first,
even if they were created later.

If you have enabled a backup shipping schedule and then later manually delete a LINSTOR
snapshot, LINSTOR might not be able to delete everything it was supposed to. For example, if you
delete a full backup snapshot definition, on a later full backup scheduled shipping, there might
be incremental snapshots based on the manually deleted full backup snapshot that will not be
deleted.

[[s-linstor-configuring-backup-shipping-schedule-keep-remote]]
===== Configuring the Keep-Remote Option

As mentioned in the callouts for the example `linstor schedule create` command above, the
`keep-remote` option only works for S3 remote destinations. Here is an example of how the
option works. If a `--keep-remote=2` option is set, then the backup shipping schedule, on first
run, will make a snapshot for a full backup and ship it to the remote destination. On the next
scheduled full backup shipping, a second snapshot is made and a full backup shipped to the
remote destination. On the next scheduled full backup shipping, a third snapshot is made and a
full backup shipped to the remote destination. This time, additionally, after the third snapshot
successfully ships, the first full backup is deleted from the remote destination. If any
incremental backups were scheduled and made between the full backups, any that were made from
the first full backup would be deleted along with the full backup.

NOTE: This option only deletes backups at the remote destination. It does not delete snapshots
that the full backups were based upon at the local source node.

[[s-linstor-listing-backup-shipping-schedule]]
==== Listing a Backup Shipping Schedule

You can list your backup shipping schedules by using the `linstor schedule list` command.

For example:

----
# linstor schedule list
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
┊ Name                ┊ Full        ┊ Incremental ┊ KeepLocal ┊ KeepRemote ┊ OnFailure ┊

╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
----

[[s-linstor-deleting-backup-shipping-schedule]]
==== Deleting a Backup Shipping Schedule

The LINSTOR client `schedule delete` command completely deletes a backup shipping schedule
LINSTOR object. The command's only argument is the schedule name that you want to delete. If the
deleted schedule is currently creating or shipping a backup, the scheduled shipping process is
stopped. Depending on at which point the process stops, a snapshot, or a backup, or both, might
not be created and shipped.

This command does not affect previously created snapshots or successfully shipped backups. These
will be retained until they are manually deleted.

[[s-linstor-enabling-backup-shipping-schedule]]
==== Enabling Scheduled Backup Shipping

You can use the LINSTOR client `backup schedule enable` command to enable a previously created
backup shipping schedule. The command has the following syntax:

[subs="verbatim, quotes"]
----
# linstor backup schedule enable \
  [--node __source_node__] \ <1>
  [--rg __resource_group_name__ | --rd __resource_definition_name__] \ <2>
  __remote_name__ \ <3>
  __schedule_name__ <4>
----

<1> This is a special option that allows you to specify the controller node that will be used as
a source for scheduled backup shipments, if possible. If you omit this option from the command,
then LINSTOR will choose a source node at the time a scheduled shipping is made. [OPTIONAL]

<2> You can set here either the resource group or the resource definition (but not both) that
you want to enable the backup shipping schedule for. If you omit this option from the command,
then the command enables scheduled backup shipping for all deployed LINSTOR resources that can
make snapshots. [OPTIONAL]

<3> The name of the remote destination that you want to ship backups to. [REQUIRED]

<4> The name of a previously created backup shipping schedule. [REQUIRED]

[[s-linstor-disabling-backup-shipping-schedule]]
==== Disabling a Backup Shipping Schedule

To disable a previously enabled backup shipping schedule, you use the LINSTOR client `backup
schedule disable` command. The command has the following syntax:

[subs="verbatim, quotes"]
----
# linstor backup schedule disable \
  [--rg __resource_group_name__ | --rd __resource_definition_name__] \
  __remote_name__ \ <3>
  __schedule_name__ <4>
----

If you include the option specifying either a resource group or resource definition, as
described in the `backup schedule enable` command example above, then you disable the schedule
only for that resource group or resource definition.

For example, if you omitted specifying a resource group or resource definition in an earlier
`backup schedule enable` command, LINSTOR would schedule backup shipping for all its deployed
resources that can make snapshots. Your disable command would then only affect the resource
group or resource definition that you specify with the command. The backup shipping schedule
would still apply to any deployed LINSTOR resources besides the specified resource group or
resource definition.

The same as for the `backup schedule enable` command, if you specify neither a resource group
nor a resource definition, then LINSTOR disables the backup shipping schedule at the controller
level for all deployed LINSTOR resources.

[[s-linstor-backup-schedule-delete-command]]
==== Deleting Aspects of a Backup Shipping Schedule

You can use the `linstor backup schedule delete` command to granularly delete either a specified
resource definition or a resource group from a backup shipping schedule, without deleting the
schedule itself. This command has the same syntax and arguments as the `backup schedule disable`
command. If you specify neither a resource group nor a resource definition, the backup shipping
schedule you specify will be deleted at the controller level.

It might be helpful to think about the `backup schedule delete` command as a way that you can
*remove* a backup shipping schedule-remote pair from a specified LINSTOR object level, either a
resource definition, a resource group, or at the controller level if neither is specified.

The `backup schedule delete` command does not affect previously created snapshots or
successfully shipped backups. These will be retained until they are manually deleted, or until
they are removed by the effects of a still applicable keep-local or keep-remote option.

You might want to use this command when you have disabled a backup schedule for multiple LINSTOR
object levels and later want to affect a granular change, where a `backup schedule enable`
command might have unintended consequences.

For example, consider a scenario where you have a backup schedule-remote pair that you enabled
at a controller level. This controller has a resource group, `myresgroup` that has several
resource definitions, `resdef1` through `resdef9`, under it. For maintenance reasons perhaps,
you disable the schedule for two resource definitions, `resdef1` and `resdef2`. You then realize
that further maintenance requires that you disable the backup shipping schedule at the resource
group level, for your `myresgroup` resource group.

After completing some maintenance, you are able to enable the backup shipping schedule for
`resdef3` through `resdef9`, but you are not yet ready to resume (enable) backup shipping for
`resdef1` and `resdef2`. You can enable backup shipping for each resource definition
individually, `resdef3` through `resdef9`, or you can use the `backup schedule delete` command
to delete the backup shipping schedule from the resource group, `myresgroup`. If you use the
`backup schedule delete` command, backups of `resdef3` through `resdef9` will ship again because
the backup shipping schedule is enabled at the controller level, but `resdef1` and `resdef2`
will not ship because the backup shipping schedule is still disabled for them at the resource
definition level.

When you complete your maintenance and are again ready to ship backups for `resdef1` and
`resdef2`, you can delete the backup shipping schedule for those two resource definitions to
return to your starting state: backup shipping scheduled for all LINSTOR deployed resources at
the controller level. To understand this it might be helpful to refer to the decision tree diagram
for how LINSTOR decides whether or not to ship a backup in the
<<s-linstor-how-controller-determines-backup-shipping>> subsection.

NOTE: In the example scenario above, you might have enabled backup shipping on the resource
group, after completing some maintenance. In this case, backup shipping would resume for
resource definitions `resdef3` through `resdef9` but continue not to ship for resource
definitions `resdef1` and `resdef2` because backup shipping was still disabled for those
resource definitions. After you completed all maintenance, you could delete the backup shipping
schedule on `resdef1` and `resdef2`. Then all of your resource definitions would be shipping
backups, as they were before your maintenance, because the schedule-remote pair was enabled at
the resource group level. However, this would remove your option to globally stop all scheduled
shipping at some later point in time at the controller level because the enabled schedule at the
resource group level would override any `schedule disable` command applied at the controller
level.

[[s-linstor-listing-backup-shipping-schedule-by-resource]]
==== Listing Backup Shipping Schedules by Resource

You can list backup schedules by resource, using the LINSTOR client `schedule list-by-resource`
command. This command will show LINSTOR resources and how any backup shipping schedules apply
and to which remotes they are being shipped. If resources are not being shipped then the command
will show:

- Whether resources have no schedule-remote-pair entries (empty cells)

- Whether they have schedule-remote-pair entries but they are disabled ("disabled")

- Whether they have no resources, so no backup shipments can be made, regardless of whether any
  schedule-remote-pair entries are enabled or not ("undeployed")

If resources have schedule-remote-pairs and are being shipped, the command output will show when
the last backup was shipped and when the next backup is scheduled to ship. It will also show
whether the next and last backup shipments were full or incremental backups. Finally, the
command will show when the next planned incremental (if any) and full backup shipping will
occur.

You can use the `--active-only` flag with the `schedule list-by-resource` command to filter out
all resources that are not being shipped.

[[s-linstor-how-controller-determines-backup-shipping]]
==== How the LINSTOR Controller Determines Scheduled Backup Shipping

To determine if the LINSTOR Controller will ship a deployed LINSTOR resource with a certain
backup schedule for a given remote destination, the LINSTOR Controller uses the following logic:

image::images/linstor-controller-backup-schedule-decision-flowchart.svg[]

As the diagram shows, enabled or disabled backup shipping schedules have effect in the following
order:

. Resource definition level

. Resource group level

. Controller level

A backup shipping schedule-remote pair that is enabled or disabled at a preceding level will
override the enabled or disabled status for the same schedule-remote pair at a later level.

[[s-linstor-how-backup-shippping-affects-resource-definitions]]
==== Determining How Scheduled Backup Shipping Affects a Resource

To determine how a LINSTOR resource will be affected by scheduled backup shipping, you can use
the LINSTOR client `schedule list-by-resource-details` command for a specified LINSTOR resource.

The command will output a table that shows on what LINSTOR object level a backup shipping
schedule is either not set (empty cell), enabled, or disabled.

By using this command, you can determine on which level you need to make a change to enable,
disable, or delete scheduled backup shipping for a resource.

Example output could look like this:

[subs="verbatim, quotes"]

[[s-linstor-setupopts]]
=== Setting DRBD Options for LINSTOR Objects

You can use LINSTOR commands to set DRBD options. Configurations in files that are not managed
by LINSTOR, such as `/etc/drbd.d/global_common.conf`, will be ignored. The syntax for this
command is generally:

----
# linstor <LINSTOR_object> drbd-options --<DRBD_option> <value> <LINSTOR_object_identifiers>
----

In the syntax above, `<LINSTOR_ object_identifiers>` is a placeholder for identifiers such as a
node name, node names, or a resource name, or a combination of these identifiers.

For example, to set the DRBD replication protocol for a resource definition named `backups`,
enter:

----
# linstor resource-definition drbd-options --protocol C backups
----

You can enter a LINSTOR object along with `drbd-options` and the `--help`, or `-h`, flag to
show the command usage, available options, and the default value for each option. For example:

----
# linstor controller drbd-options -h
----

[[s-linstor-setup-drbd-peer-opts]]
==== Setting DRBD Peer Options for LINSTOR Resources or Resource Connections

The LINSTOR resource object is an exception to the general syntax for setting DRBD options for
LINSTOR objects. With the LINSTOR resource object, you can use the `drbd-peer-options` to set
DRBD options at the connection level between the two nodes that you specify. Specifying
`drbd-peer-options` for a LINSTOR resource object between two nodes is equivalent to using
the`linstor resource-connection drbd-peer-options` for a resource between two nodes.

For example, to set the DRBD maximum buffer size to 8192 at a connection level, for a resource
named `backups`, between two nodes, `node-0` and `node-1`, enter:

----
# linstor resource drbd-peer-options --max-buffers 8192 node-0 node-1 backups
----

The command above is equivalent to the following:

----
# linstor resource-connection drbd-peer-options --max-buffers 8192 node-0 node-1 backups
----

Indeed, when using the `linstor --curl` command to examine the two commands actions on the
LINSTOR REST API, the output is identical:

----
# linstor --curl resource drbd-peer-options --max-buffers 8192 node-0 node-1 backups
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"override_props": {"DrbdOptions/Net/max-buffers": "8192"}}' http://localhost:3370/v1/resource-definitions/backups/resource-connections/node-0/node-1

# linstor --curl resource-connection drbd-peer-options --max-buffers 8192 node-0 node-1 backups
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"override_props": {"DrbdOptions/Net/max-buffers": "8192"}}' http://localhost:3370/v1/resource-definitions/backups/resource-connections/node-0/node-1
----

The connection section of the LINSTOR-generated resource file `backups.res` on `node-0` will
look something like this:

----
connection {
        _peer_node_id 1;
        path {
            _this_host ipv4 192.168.222.10:7000;
            _remote_host ipv4 192.168.222.11:7000;
        }
        path {
            _this_host ipv4 192.168.121.46:7000;
            _remote_host ipv4 192.168.121.220:7000;
        }
        net {
			[...]
            max-buffers         8192;
            _name               "node-1";
        }
    }
----

NOTE: If there are multiple paths between the two nodes, as in the example above, DRBD options
that you set using the `resource drbd-peer-options` command will apply to all of them.

[[s-linstor-setup-node-connection-drbd-opts]]
==== Setting DRBD Options for Node Connections

You can use the `drbd-peer-options` argument to set DRBD options at a connection level, between
two nodes, for example:

----
# linstor node-connection drbd-peer-options --ping-timeout 299 node-0 node-1
----

The preceding command would set the DRBD `ping-timeout` option to 29.9 seconds at a connection
level between two nodes, `node-0` and `node-1`.

[[s-linstor-verifying-opts]]
==== Verifying Options for LINSTOR Objects

You can verify a LINSTOR object's set properties by using the `list-properties` command, for
example:

----
# linstor resource-definition list-properties backups
+------------------------------------------------------+
| Key                               | Value            |
|======================================================|
| DrbdOptions/Net/protocol          | C                |
[...]
----

[[s-linstor-unset-opts]]
==== Removing DRBD Options from LINSTOR Objects

To remove a previously set DRBD option, prefix the option name with `unset-`. For example:

----
# linstor resource-definition drbd-options --unset-protocol backups
----

The same syntax applies to any `drbd-peer-options` set either on a LINSTOR resource, resource
connection, or node connection. For example:

----
# linstor resource-connection drbd-peer-options --unset-max-buffers node-0 node-1 backups
----

Removing a DRBD option or DRBD peer option will return the option to its default value. Refer to
the `linstor <LINSTOR_object> drbd-options --help` (or `drbd-peer-options --help`) command
output for the default values of options. You can also refer to the `drbd.conf-9.0` man page to
get information about DRBD options.

[[s-linstor-toggle-disk]]
=== Adding and Removing Disks

LINSTOR can convert resources between diskless and having a disk. This is achieved with the
`resource toggle-disk` command, which has syntax similar to `resource create`.

For instance, add a disk to the diskless resource `backups` on 'alpha':

----
# linstor resource toggle-disk alpha backups --storage-pool pool_ssd
----

Remove this disk again:

----
# linstor resource toggle-disk alpha backups --diskless
----

[[s-linstor-migrate-disk]]
==== Migrating Disks Between Nodes

To move a resource between nodes without reducing redundancy at any point, LINSTOR's disk
migrate feature can be used. First create a diskless resource on the target node, and then add
a disk using the `--migrate-from` option. This will wait until the data has been synced to the
new disk and then remove the source disk.

For example, to migrate a resource `backups` from 'alpha' to 'bravo':

----
# linstor resource create bravo backups --drbd-diskless
# linstor resource toggle-disk bravo backups --storage-pool pool_ssd --migrate-from alpha
----

[[s-linstor-proxy]]
=== Configuring DRBD Proxy Using LINSTOR

LINSTOR expects DRBD Proxy to be running on the nodes which are involved in the relevant
connections. It does not currently support connections through DRBD Proxy on a separate node.

Suppose your cluster consists of nodes 'alpha' and 'bravo' in a local network and 'charlie' at a
remote site, with a resource definition named `backups` deployed to each of the nodes. Then DRBD
Proxy can be enabled for the connections to 'charlie' as follows:

----
# linstor drbd-proxy enable alpha charlie backups
# linstor drbd-proxy enable bravo charlie backups
----

The DRBD Proxy configuration can be tailored with commands such as:

----
# linstor drbd-proxy options backups --memlimit 100000000
# linstor drbd-proxy compression zlib backups --level 9
----

LINSTOR does not automatically optimize the DRBD configuration for long-distance replication, so
you will probably want to set some configuration options such as the protocol:

----
# linstor resource-connection drbd-options alpha charlie backups --protocol A
# linstor resource-connection drbd-options bravo charlie backups --protocol A
----

Contact LINBIT for assistance optimizing your configuration.

==== Automatically Enabling DRBD Proxy

LINSTOR can also be configured to automatically enable the above mentioned Proxy connection
between two nodes. For this automation, LINSTOR first needs to know on which site each node is.

----
# linstor node set-property alpha Site A
# linstor node set-property bravo Site A
# linstor node set-property charlie Site B
----

As the `Site` property might also be used for other site-based decisions in future features, the
`DrbdProxy/AutoEnable` also has to be set to `true`:

----
# linstor controller set-property DrbdProxy/AutoEnable true
----

This property can also be set on node, resource-definition, resource and resource-connection
level (from left to right in increasing priority, whereas the controller is the leftmost, that
is, the least prioritized level).

Once this initialization steps are completed, every newly created resource will automatically
check if it has to enable DRBD Proxy to any of its peer-resources.


[[s-linstor-external-database]]
=== External Database Providers

It is possible to have LINSTOR working with an external database provider like PostgreSQL,
MariaDB and since version 1.1.0 even etcd key value store is supported.

To use an external database there are a few additional steps to configure. You have to create a
DB/Schema and user to use for linstor, and configure this in the `/etc/linstor/linstor.toml`.


[[s-postgresql]]
==== PostgreSQL

A sample PostgreSQL `linstor.toml` looks like this:

----
[db]
user = "linstor"
password = "linstor"
connection_url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/linstor"
----

[[s-mariadb_mysql]]
==== MariaDB and MySQL

A sample MariaDB `linstor.toml` looks like this:

----
[db]
user = "linstor"
password = "linstor"
connection_url = "jdbc:mariadb://localhost/LINSTOR?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true"
----

NOTE: The LINSTOR schema/database is created as `LINSTOR` so verify that the MariaDB connection
string refers to the `LINSTOR` schema, as in the example above.

[[s-etcd]]
==== etcd

etcd is a distributed key-value store that makes it easy to keep your LINSTOR database
distributed in a HA-setup. The etcd driver is already included in the LINSTOR-controller
package and only needs to be configured in the `linstor.toml`.

More information about how to install and configure etcd can be found here:
https://etcd.io/docs[etcd docs]

And here is a sample [db] section from the `linstor.toml`:

----
[db]
## only set user/password if you want to use authentication, only since LINSTOR 1.2.1
# user = "linstor"
# password = "linstor"

## for etcd
## do not set user field if no authentication required
connection_url = "etcd://etcdhost1:2379,etcdhost2:2379,etcdhost3:2379"

## if you want to use TLS, only since LINSTOR 1.2.1
# ca_certificate = "ca.pem"
# client_certificate = "client.pem"

## if you want to use client TLS authentication too, only since LINSTOR 1.2.1
# client_key_pkcs8_pem = "client-key.pkcs8"
## set client_key_password if private key has a password
# client_key_password = "mysecret"
----

[[s-linstor-controller-config]]
=== Configuring the LINSTOR Controller

The LINSTOR Controller has a configuration file that is and has to be placed into the following
path: `/etc/linstor/linstor.toml`.

A recent configuration example can be found here:
https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-server/blob/master/docs/linstor.toml-example[`linstor.toml-example`]

[[s-linstor-rest-api]]
==== LINSTOR REST API

To make LINSTOR's administrative tasks more accessible and also available for web-frontends a
REST API has been created. The REST API is embedded in the LINSTOR controller and since LINSTOR
0.9.13 configured through the `linstor.toml` configuration file.

----
[http]
  enabled = true
  port = 3370
  listen_addr = "127.0.0.1"  # to disable remote access
----

If you want to use the REST API the current documentation can be found on the following link:
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Linstor/Linstor/

[[s-linstor-rest-api-https]]
==== LINSTOR REST API HTTPS

The HTTP REST API can also run secured by HTTPS and is highly recommended if you use any
features that require authorization. To do so you have to create a Java keystore file with a
valid certificate that will be used to encrypt all HTTPS traffic.

Here is a simple example on how you can create a self signed certificate with the `keytool` that
is included in the Java Runtime:

----
keytool -keyalg rsa -keysize 2048 -genkey -keystore ./keystore_linstor.jks\
 -alias linstor_controller\
 -dname "CN=localhost, OU=SecureUnit, O=ExampleOrg, L=Vienna, ST=Austria, C=AT"
----

`keytool` will ask for a password to secure the generated keystore file and is needed for the
LINSTOR Controller configuration. In your `linstor.toml` file you have to add the following
section:

----
[https]
  keystore = "/path/to/keystore_linstor.jks"
  keystore_password = "linstor"
----

Now (re)start the `linstor-controller` and the HTTPS REST API should be available on port 3371.

More information about how to import other certificates can be found here:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html

IMPORTANT: After enabling HTTPS access, all requests to the HTTP v1 REST API will be redirected
to the HTTPS redirect. If your have not
<<s-linstor-configuration-file-specifying-controllers,specified a LINSTOR controller in the
LINSTOR configuration TOML file>> (`/etc/linstor/linstor.toml`), then you will need to use a
different syntax when using the LINSTOR client (`linstor`) as described in
<<s-using_the_linstor_client>>. 

[[s-rest-api-https-restricted-client]]
===== LINSTOR REST API HTTPS Restricted Client Access

Client access can be restricted by using a SSL/TLS truststore on the Controller. Basically you
create a certificate for your client and add it to your truststore and the client then uses this
certificate for authentication.

First create a client certificate:

----
keytool -keyalg rsa -keysize 2048 -genkey -keystore client.jks\
 -storepass linstor -keypass linstor\
 -alias client1\
 -dname "CN=Client Cert, OU=client, O=Example, L=Vienna, ST=Austria, C=AT"
----

Next, import this certificate to your controller truststore:

----
keytool -importkeystore\
 -srcstorepass linstor -deststorepass linstor -keypass linstor\
 -srckeystore client.jks -destkeystore trustore_client.jks
----

And enable the truststore in the `linstor.toml` configuration file:

----
[https]
  keystore = "/path/to/keystore_linstor.jks"
  keystore_password = "linstor"
  truststore = "/path/to/trustore_client.jks"
  truststore_password = "linstor"
----

Now restart the Controller and it will no longer be possible to access the controller API
without a correct certificate.

The LINSTOR client needs the certificate in PEM format, so before you can use it, you have to
convert the java keystore certificate to the PEM format.

----
# Convert to pkcs12
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore client.jks -destkeystore client.p12\
 -storepass linstor -keypass linstor\
 -srcalias client1 -srcstoretype jks -deststoretype pkcs12

# use openssl to convert to PEM
openssl pkcs12 -in client.p12 -out client_with_pass.pem
----

To avoid entering the PEM file password all the time it might be convenient to remove the
password.

----
openssl rsa -in client_with_pass.pem -out client1.pem
openssl x509 -in client_with_pass.pem >> client1.pem
----

Now this PEM file can easily be used in the client:

----
linstor --certfile client1.pem node list
----


The `--certfile` parameter can also added to the client configuration file, see
<<s-using_the_linstor_client>> for more details.

[[s-linstor-satellite-config]]
=== Configuring LINSTOR Satellite

The LINSTOR Satellite software has an optional configuration file that uses the TOML file syntax
and has to be put into the following path `/etc/linstor/linstor_satellite.toml`.

A recent configuration example can be found here:
https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-server/blob/master/docs/linstor_satellite.toml-example[linstor_satellite.toml-example]

[[s-linstor-logging]]
=== Logging

LINSTOR uses https://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J] with https://logback.qos.ch/[logback] as binding.
This gives LINSTOR the possibility to distinguish between the log levels `ERROR`, `WARN`,
`INFO`, `DEBUG` and `TRACE` (in order of increasing verbosity). The following are
the different ways that you can set the logging level, ordered by priority (first has highest
priority):

. Since LINSTOR *client* version 1.20.1, you can use the command `controller set-log-level` to
  change the log level used by LINSTOR's running configuration. Various arguments can be used
  with this command. Refer to the command's `--help` text for details. For example, to set the
  log level to `TRACE` on the LINSTOR controller and all satellites, enter the following
  command:
+
----
$ linstor controller set-log-level --global TRACE
----
+
To change the LINSTOR log level on a particular node, you can use the LINSTOR client (since
version 1.20.1) command `node set-log-level`.
+
NOTE: Changes that you make to the log level by using the LINSTOR client will not persist
LINSTOR service restarts, for example, if a node reboots.

. `TRACE` mode can be `enabled` or `disabled` using the debug console:
+
----
Command ==> SetTrcMode MODE(enabled)
SetTrcMode           Set TRACE level logging mode
New TRACE level logging mode: ENABLED
----

. When starting the controller or satellite a command line argument can be passed:
+
----
java ... com.linbit.linstor.core.Controller ... --log-level TRACE
java ... com.linbit.linstor.core.Satellite  ... --log-level TRACE
----

. The recommended place is the `logging` section in the configuration file.  The default
  configuration file location is `/etc/linstor/linstor.toml` for the controller and
  `/etc/linstor/linstor_satellite.toml` for the satellite.  Configure the logging level as
  follows:
+
----
[logging]
   level="TRACE"
----

. As LINSTOR is using logback as an implementation, `/usr/share/linstor-server/lib/logback.xml`
  can also be used. Currently only this approach supports different log levels for different
  components, like shown in the example below:
+
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration scan="false" scanPeriod="60 seconds">
<!--
 Values for scanPeriod can be specified in units of milliseconds, seconds, minutes or hours

 </logger>
 <root level="WARN">

   <!-- <appender-ref ref="FILE" /> -->
 </root>
</configuration>
----

See the https://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html[logback manual] to find more details about
`logback.xml`.

When none of the configuration methods above is used LINSTOR will default to `INFO` log level.

[[s-linstor-monitoring]]
=== Monitoring

Since LINSTOR 1.8.0, a https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] `/metrics` HTTP path is provided with
LINSTOR and JVM specific exports.

The `/metrics` path also supports three GET arguments to reduce LINSTOR's reported data:

 * `resource`
 * `storage_pools`
 * `error_reports`

These all default to `true`. To disable, for example, error report data use:
`http://localhost:3370/metrics?error_reports=false`.

==== Health Checking

The LINSTOR-Controller also provides a `/health` HTTP path that will simply return HTTP-Status
200 if the controller can access its database and all services are up and running. Otherwise it
will return HTTP error status code 500 `Internal Server Error`.

[[s-linstor-secure-connections]]
=== Secure Satellite Connections

It is possible to have the LINSTOR use SSL/TLS secure TCP connection between controller and
satellite connections. Without going into further details on how Java's SSL/TLS engine works we
will give you command line snippets using the `keytool` from Java's runtime environment on how
to configure a three node setup using secure connections.

The node setup looks like this:

Node `alpha` is just the controller. Node `bravo` and node `charlie` are just satellites.

Here are the commands to generate such a keystore setup, values should of course be edited for
your environment.

----
# create directories to hold the key files
mkdir -p /tmp/linstor-ssl
cd /tmp/linstor-ssl
mkdir alpha bravo charlie


# create private keys for all nodes
keytool -keyalg rsa -keysize 2048 -genkey -keystore alpha/keystore.jks\
 -storepass linstor -keypass linstor\
 -alias alpha\
 -dname "CN=Max Mustermann, OU=alpha, O=Example, L=Vienna, ST=Austria, C=AT"

keytool -keyalg rsa -keysize 2048 -genkey -keystore bravo/keystore.jks\
 -storepass linstor -keypass linstor\
 -alias bravo\
 -dname "CN=Max Mustermann, OU=bravo, O=Example, L=Vienna, ST=Austria, C=AT"

keytool -keyalg rsa -keysize 2048 -genkey -keystore charlie/keystore.jks\
 -storepass linstor -keypass linstor\
 -alias charlie\
 -dname "CN=Max Mustermann, OU=charlie, O=Example, L=Vienna, ST=Austria, C=AT"

# import truststore certificates for alpha (needs all satellite certificates)
keytool -importkeystore\
 -srcstorepass linstor -deststorepass linstor -keypass linstor\
 -srckeystore bravo/keystore.jks -destkeystore alpha/certificates.jks

keytool -importkeystore\
 -srcstorepass linstor -deststorepass linstor -keypass linstor\
 -srckeystore charlie/keystore.jks -destkeystore alpha/certificates.jks

# import controller certificate into satellite truststores
keytool -importkeystore\
 -srcstorepass linstor -deststorepass linstor -keypass linstor\
 -srckeystore alpha/keystore.jks -destkeystore bravo/certificates.jks

keytool -importkeystore\
 -srcstorepass linstor -deststorepass linstor -keypass linstor\
 -srckeystore alpha/keystore.jks -destkeystore charlie/certificates.jks

# now copy the keystore files to their host destinations
ssh root@alpha mkdir /etc/linstor/ssl
scp alpha/* root@alpha:/etc/linstor/ssl/
ssh root@bravo mkdir /etc/linstor/ssl
scp bravo/* root@bravo:/etc/linstor/ssl/
ssh root@charlie mkdir /etc/linstor/ssl
scp charlie/* root@charlie:/etc/linstor/ssl/

# generate the satellite ssl config entry
echo '[netcom]
  type="ssl"
  port=3367
  server_certificate="ssl/keystore.jks"
  trusted_certificates="ssl/certificates.jks"
  key_password="linstor"
  keystore_password="linstor"
  truststore_password="linstor"
  ssl_protocol="TLSv1.2"
' | ssh root@bravo "cat > /etc/linstor/linstor_satellite.toml"

echo '[netcom]
  type="ssl"
  port=3367
  server_certificate="ssl/keystore.jks"
  trusted_certificates="ssl/certificates.jks"
  key_password="linstor"
  keystore_password="linstor"
  truststore_password="linstor"
  ssl_protocol="TLSv1.2"
' | ssh root@charlie "cat > /etc/linstor/linstor_satellite.toml"
----

Now just start controller and satellites and add the nodes with `--communication-type SSL`.

[[s-linstor-ldap-authentication]]
=== Configuring LDAP Authentication

You can configure LINSTOR to use LDAP authentication to limit access to the LINSTOR Controller.
This feature is disabled by default but you can enable and configure it by editing the LINSTOR
configuration TOML file. After editing the configuration file, you will need to restart the
`linstor-controller.service`. An example LDAP section within the configuration file looks like
this:

----
[ldap]
  enabled = true <1>

  # allow_public_access: if no authorization fields are given allow
  # users to work with the public context
  allow_public_access = false <2>

  # uniform resource identifier: LDAP URI to use
  # for example, "ldaps://hostname" (LDAPS) or "ldap://hostname" (LDAP)
  uri = "ldaps://ldap.example.com"

  # distinguished name: {user} can be used as template for the username
  dn = "uid={user}" <3>

  # search base for the search_filter field
  search_base = "dc=example,dc=com" <4>

  # search_filter: ldap filter to restrict users on memberships
  search_filter = "(&(uid={user})(memberof=ou=storage-services,dc=example,dc=com))" <5>
----

<1> `enabled` is a Boolean value. Authentication is disabled by default.

<2> `allow_public_access` is a Boolean value. If set to true, and LDAP authentication is
enabled, then users will be allowed to work with the LINSTOR Controller's public context. If
set to false and LDAP authentication is enabled, then users without LDAP authenticating
credentials will be unable to access the LINSTOR Controller for all but the most trivial tasks,
such as displaying version or help information.

<3> `dn` is a string value where you can specify the LDAP distinguished name to query the LDAP
directory. Besides the user ID (`uid`), the string can consist of other distinguished name
attributes, for example:
+
----
dn = "uid={user},ou=storage-services,o=ha,dc=example"
----

<4> `search_base` is a string value where you can specify the starting point in the LDAP
directory tree for the authentication query, for example:
+
----
search_base = "ou=storage-services"
----

<5> `search_filter` is a string value where you can specify an LDAP object restriction for
authentication, such as user and group membership, for example:
+
----
search_filter = "(&(uid={user})(memberof=ou=storage-services,dc=example,dc=com))"
----

WARNING: It is highly recommended that you configure <<s-linstor-rest-api-https,LINSTOR REST API
HTTPS>> and LDAPS to protect potentially sensitive traffic passing between the LINSTOR
Controller and an LDAP server.

==== Running LINSTOR Commands as an Authenticated User

After configuring the LINSTOR Controller to authenticate users through LDAP (or LDAPS), and the
LINSTOR REST API HTTPS, you will need to enter LINSTOR commands as follows:

----
$ linstor --user <LDAP_user_name> <command>
----

If you have configured LDAP authentication without also configuring
<<s-linstor-rest-api-https,LINSTOR REST API HTTPS>>, you will need to explicitly enable password
authentication over HTTP, by using the `--allow-insecure-path` flag with your `linstor`
commands. This is not recommended outside of a secured and isolated LAN, as you will be sending
credentials in plain text.

----
$ linstor --allow-insecure-auth --user <LDAP_user_name> <command>
----

The LINSTOR Controller will prompt you for the user's password, in each of the above examples.
You can optionally use the `--password` argument to supply the user's password on the command
line, with all the warnings of caution that would go along with doing so.

[[s-linstor-drbd-automatisms]]
=== Automatisms for DRBD Resources

This section details some of LINSTOR's automatisms for DRBD resources.

[[s-linstor-auto-quorum]]
==== Auto-Quorum Policies

LINSTOR automatically configures quorum policies on resources *when quorum is achievable*. This
means, whenever you have at least two diskful and one or more diskless resource assignments, or
three or more diskful resource assignments, LINSTOR will enable quorum policies for your
resources automatically.

Inversely, LINSTOR will automatically disable quorum policies whenever there are less than the
minimum required resource assignments to achieve quorum.

This is controlled through the, `DrbdOptions/auto-quorum`, property which can be applied to the
`linstor-controller`, `resource-group`, and `resource-definition` LINSTOR objects. Accepted
values for the `DrbdOptions/auto-quorum` property are `disabled`, `suspend-io`, and `io-error`.

Setting the `DrbdOptions/auto-quorum` property to `disabled` will allow you to manually, or more
granularly, control the quorum policies of your resources should you want to.

TIP: The default policies for `DrbdOptions/auto-quorum` are `quorum majority`, and `on-no-quorum
io-error`. For more information about DRBD's quorum features and their behavior, refer to the
{url-drbd-ug}#s-feature-quorum[quorum section of the _DRBD User's Guide_].

IMPORTANT: The `DrbdOptions/auto-quorum` policies will override any manually configured
properties if `DrbdOptions/auto-quorum` is not disabled.

For example, to manually set the quorum policies of a resource group named `my_ssd_group`, you
would use the following commands:

----
# linstor resource-group set-property my_ssd_group DrbdOptions/auto-quorum disabled
# linstor resource-group set-property my_ssd_group DrbdOptions/Resource/quorum majority
# linstor resource-group set-property my_ssd_group DrbdOptions/Resource/on-no-quorum suspend-io
----

You might want to disable DRBD's quorum features completely. To do that, you would need to first
disable `DrbdOptions/auto-quorum` on the appropriate LINSTOR object, and then set the DRBD
quorum features accordingly. For example, use the following commands to disable quorum
entirely on the `my_ssd_group` resource group:

----
# linstor resource-group set-property my_ssd_group DrbdOptions/auto-quorum disabled
# linstor resource-group set-property my_ssd_group DrbdOptions/Resource/quorum off
# linstor resource-group set-property my_ssd_group DrbdOptions/Resource/on-no-quorum
----

NOTE: Setting `DrbdOptions/Resource/on-no-quorum` to an empty value in the commands above
deletes the property from the object entirely.

[[s-linstor-auto-evict]]
==== Auto-Evict

If a satellite is offline for a prolonged period of time, LINSTOR can be configured to
declare that node as evicted. This triggers an automated reassignment of the affected
DRBD resources to other nodes to ensure a minimum replica count is kept.

This feature uses the following properties to adapt the behavior.

* `DrbdOptions/AutoEvictMinReplicaCount` sets the number of replicas that should always be
  present. You can set this property on the controller to change a global default, or on a
  specific resource definition or resource group to change it only for that resource definition
  or resource group. If this property is left empty, the place count set for the Autoplacer of
  the corresponding resource group will be used.

* `DrbdOptions/AutoEvictAfterTime` describes how long a node can be offline in minutes before
  the eviction is triggered. You can set this property on the controller to change a global
  default, or on a single node to give it a different behavior. The default value for this
  property is 60 minutes.

* `DrbdOptions/AutoEvictMaxDisconnectedNodes` sets the percentage of nodes that can be not
  reachable (for whatever reason) at the same time. If more than the given percent of nodes are
  offline at the same time, the auto-evict will not be triggered for any node , since in this
  case LINSTOR assumes connection problems from the controller. This property can only be set
  for the controller, and only accepts a value between 0 and 100. The default value is 34. If
  you want to turn the auto-evict-feature off, simply set this property to 0. If you want to
  always trigger the auto-evict, regardless of how many satellites are unreachable, set it to
  100.

* `DrbdOptions/AutoEvictAllowEviction` is an additional property that can stop a node from being
  evicted. This can be useful for various cases, for example if you need to shut down a node for
  maintenance. You can set this property on the controller to change a global default, or on a
  single node to give it a different behavior. It accepts true and false as values and per
  default is set to true on the controller. You can use this property to turn the auto-evict
  feature off by setting it to false on the controller, although this might not work completely
  if you already set different values for individual nodes, since those values take precedence
  over the global default.

After the LINSTOR controller loses the connection to a satellite, aside from trying to
reconnect, it starts a timer for that satellite. As soon as that timer exceeds
`DrbdOptions/AutoEvictAfterTime` and all of the DRBD connections to the DRBD resources on that
satellite are broken, the controller will check whether or not
`DrbdOptions/AutoEvictMaxDisconnectedNodes` has been met. If it has not, and
`DrbdOptions/AutoEvictAllowEviction` is true for the node in question, the satellite will be
marked as EVICTED. At the same time, the controller will check for every DRBD-resource whether
the number of resources is still above `DrbdOptions/AutoEvictMinReplicaCount`. If it is, the
resource in question will be marked as DELETED. If it isn't, an auto-place with the settings
from the corresponding resource-group will be started. Should the auto-place fail, the
controller will try again later when changes that might allow a different result, such as adding
a new node, have happened. Resources where an auto-place is necessary will only be marked as
DELETED if the corresponding auto-place was successful.

The evicted satellite itself will not be able to reestablish connection with the controller.
Even if the node is up and running, a manual reconnect will fail. It is also not possible to
delete the satellite, even if it is working as it should be. The satellite can, however, be
restored. This will remove the EVICTED-flag from the satellite and allow you to use it again.
Previously configured network interfaces, storage pools, properties and similar entities,
non-DRBD-related resources, and resources that LINSTOR could not autoplace somewhere else will
still be on the satellite. To restore a satellite, use the following command:

----
# linstor node restore [nodename]
----

Should you want to instead throw everything that once was on that node, including the node
itself, away, you need to use the `node lost` command instead.

[[s-linstor-auto-diskful]]
==== Auto-Diskful and Related Options

You can set the LINSTOR `auto-diskful` and `auto-diskful-allow-cleanup` properties for various
LINSTOR objects, for example, a resource definition, to have LINSTOR help automatically make
a _Diskless_ node _Diskful_ and perform appropriate cleanup actions afterwards.

This is useful when a _Diskless_ node has been in a _Primary_ state for a DRBD resource for more
than a specified number of minutes. This could happen in cases where you integrate LINSTOR
managed storage with other orchestrating and scheduling platforms, such as OpenStack,
OpenNebula, and others. On some platforms that you integrate LINSTOR with, you might not have a
way to influence where in your cluster a storage volume will be used.

The auto-diskful options give you a way to use LINSTOR to sensibly delegate the roles of your
storage nodes in response to an integrated platform's actions that are beyond your control.

[[s-linstor-auto-diskful-setting]]
===== Setting the Auto-Diskful Option

By setting the `DrbdOptions/auto-diskful` option on a LINSTOR resource definition , you are
configuring the LINSTOR controller to make a _Diskless_ DRBD resource _Diskful_ if the resource
has been in a DRBD _Primary_ state for more than the specified number of minutes. After the
specified number of minutes, LINSTOR will automatically use the
<<s-linstor-toggle-disk,`resource toggle-disk` command>> to toggle the resource state on the
_Diskless_ node, for the given resource.

To set this property, for example, on a LINSTOR resource definition named `myres` with a
threshold of five minutes, enter the command:

----
# linstor resource-definition set-property myres DrbdOptions/auto-diskful 5
----

[[s-linstor-auto-diskful-setting-on-rg-or-controller]]
===== Setting the Auto-Diskful Option on a Resource Group or Controller

You can also set the `DrbdOptions/auto-diskful` option on LINSTOR `controller` or
`resource-group` objects. By setting the option at the controller level, the option will affect
all LINSTOR resource definitions in your LINSTOR cluster that do not have this option set,
either on the resource definition itself, or else on the resource group that you might have
created the resource from.

Setting the option on a LINSTOR resource group will affect all resource definitions that are
spawned from the group, unless a resource definition has the option set on it.

The order of priority, from highest to lowest, for the effect of setting the `auto-diskful`
option is:

- Resource definition
- Resource group
- Controller

[[s-linstor-auto-diskful-unsetting]]
===== Unsetting the Auto-Diskful Option

To unset the LINSTOR `auto-diskful` option, enter:

----
# linstor <controller|resource-definition|resource-group> set-property DrbdOptions/auto-diskful
----

[[s-linstor-auto-diskful-allow-cleanup-setting]]
===== Setting the Auto-Diskful-Allow-Cleanup Option

A companion option to the LINSTOR `auto-diskful` option is the
`DrbdOptions/auto-diskful-allow-cleanup` option.

You can set this option on the following LINSTOR objects: node, resource, resource definition,
or resource group. The default value for this option is `True`, but the option has no effect
unless the `auto-diskful` option has also been set.

After LINSTOR has toggled a resource to _Diskful_, because the threshold number of minutes has
passed where a _Diskless_ node was in the _Primary_ role for a resource, and after DRBD has
synchronized the data to this previously _Diskless_ and now _Primary_ node, LINSTOR will remove
the resource from any _Secondary_ nodes when that action is necessary to fulfill a replica count
constraint that the resource might have. This could be the case, for example, if you have
specified number of replicas for a resource by using the `--auto-place` option.

[[s-linstor-drbd-skip-disk]]
==== SkipDisk

If a device is throwing I/O errors, for example, due to physical failure, DRBD detects this state and
automatically detaches from the local disk. All read and write requests are forwarded to a still
healthy peer, allowing the application to continue without interruption.

This automatic detaching causes new event entries in the
link:https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/drbd-guide-9_0-en/#s-drbdsetup-events2[`drbdsetup events2`]
stream, changing the state of a DRBD volume from `UpToDate` to `Failed` and finally to `Diskless`.
LINSTOR detects these state changes, and automatically sets the `DrbdOptions/SkipDisk` property to
`True` on the given resource. This property causes the LINSTOR satellite service running on the node
with the device throwing I/O errors to attach a `--skip-disk` to all `drbdadm adjust` commands.

If this property is set, the `linstor resource list` command also shows it accordingly:
----
# linstor r l
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
┊ ResourceName ┊ Node  ┊ Port ┊ Usage  ┊ Conns ┊                   State ┊ CreatedOn           ┊
╞══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╡
┊ rsc          ┊ bravo ┊ 7000 ┊ Unused ┊ Ok    ┊ UpToDate, Skip-Disk (R) ┊ 2024-03-18 11:48:08 ┊
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
----

The `\(R)` in this case already states that the property is set on the resource. The indicator would
change to `(R, N)` if the property `DrbdOptions/SkipDisk` were to be set on the resource *and* on
node levels.

Although this property is automatically enabled by LINSTOR, after you resolve the cause of the I/O
errors, you need to manually remove the property to get back to a healthy `UpToDate` state:

----
# linstor resource set-property bravo rsc DrbdOptions/SkipDisk
----

[[s-linstor-qos]]
=== QoS Settings

LINSTOR implements QoS for managed resources by using sysfs properties that correspond to
kernel variables related to block I/O operations. These sysfs properties can be limits on
either bandwidth (bytes per second), or IOPS, or both.

The sysfs files and their corresponding LINSTOR properties are as follows:

[cols="3,2"]
|===
| sysfs (`/sys/fs/`) | LINSTOR Property

| `cgroup/blkio/blkio.throttle.read_bps_device` | `sys/fs/blkio_throttle_read`
| `cgroup/blkio/blkio.throttle.write_bps_device` | `sys/fs/blkio_throttle_write`
| `cgroup/blkio/blkio.throttle.read_iops_device` | `sys/fs/blkio_throttle_read_iops`
| `cgroup/blkio/blkio.throttle.write_iops_device` | `sys/fs/blkio_throttle_write_iops`
|===

==== Setting QoS Using LINSTOR sysfs Properties

These LINSTOR properties can be set by using the `set-property` command and can be set on the
following objects: volume, storage pool, resource, controller, or node. You can also set these
QoS properties on resource groups, volume groups, resource definitions, or volume definitions.
When you set a QoS property on a group or definition, resources created from the group or
definition will inherit the QoS settings.

IMPORTANT: Settings made to a group or definition will affect both existing and new resources
created from the group or definition.

The following example shows creating a resource group, then creating a volume group, then
applying QoS settings to the volume group, and then spawning resources from the resource
group. A verification command will show that the spawned resources inherit the QoS settings.
The example uses an assumed previously created LINSTOR storage pool named _pool1_. You will
need to replace this name with a storage pool name that exists in your environment.

----
# linstor resource-group create qos_limited --storage-pool pool1 --place-count 3
# linstor volume-group create qos_limited
# linstor volume-group set-property qos_limited 0 sys/fs/blkio_throttle_write 1048576
# linstor resource-group spawn-resources qos_limited qos_limited_res 200M
----

To verify that the spawned resources inherited the QoS setting, you can show the contents of
the corresponding sysfs file, on a node that contributes storage to the storage pool.

----
# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/blkio.throttle.write_bps_device
252:4 1048576
----

NOTE: As the QoS properties are inherited and not copied, you will not see the property listed
in any "child" objects that have been spawned from the "parent" group or definition.

==== QoS Settings for a LINSTOR Volume Having Multiple DRBD Devices

A single LINSTOR volume can be composed of multiple DRBD devices. For example, DRBD with
external metadata will have three backing devices: a data (storage) device, a metadata device,
and the composite DRBD device (volume) provided to LINSTOR. If the data and metadata devices
correspond to different backing disks, then if you set a sysfs property for such a LINSTOR
volume, only the local data (storage) backing device will receive the property value in the
corresponding `/sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/` file. Neither the device backing DRBD's metadata, nor
the composite backing device provided to LINSTOR would receive the value. However, when DRBD's
data and its metadata share the same backing disk, QoS settings will affect the performance of
both data and metadata operations.

==== QoS Settings for NVMe

In case a LINSTOR resource definition has an `nvme-target` and an `nvme-initiator`
resource, both data (storage) backing devices of each node will receive the sysfs property
value. In case of the target, the data backing device will be the volume of either LVM or ZFS,
whereas in case of the initiator, the data backing device will be the connected `nvme-device`,
regardless of which other LINSTOR layers, such as LUKS, NVMe, DRBD, and others (see
<<s-linstor-without-drbd>>), are above that.

=== Getting Help

==== From the Command Line

A quick way to list available commands on the command line is to enter `linstor`.

Further information about subcommands, for example, listing nodes) can be retrieved in two ways:

----
# linstor node list -h
# linstor help node list
----

Using the 'help' subcommand is especially helpful when LINSTOR is executed in interactive mode
(`linstor interactive`).

One of the most helpful features of LINSTOR is its rich tab-completion, which can be used to
complete nearly every object that LINSTOR knows about, for example, node names, IP addresses,
resource names, and others. The following examples show some possible completions, and their
results:

----
# linstor node create alpha 1<tab> # completes the IP address if hostname can be resolved
# linstor resource create b<tab> c<tab> # linstor assign-resource backups charlie
----

If tab-completion does not work upon installing the LINSTOR client, try to source the
appropriate file:

----
# source /etc/bash_completion.d/linstor # or
# source /usr/share/bash_completion/completions/linstor
----

For Z shell users, the `linstor-client` command can generate a Z shell compilation file,
that has basic support for command and argument completion.

----
# linstor gen-zsh-completer > /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Linux/_linstor
----

[[s-linstor-sos-reports]]
==== Generating SOS Reports

If something goes wrong and you need help finding the cause of the issue, you can enter the
following command: 

----
# linstor sos-report create
----

The command above will create a new sos-report in the `/var/log/linstor/controller` directory on
the controller node. Alternatively you can enter the following command: 

----
# linstor sos-report download
----

This command will create a new SOS report and download that report to the current working
directory on your local machine.

This SOS report contains logs and useful debug-information from several sources (LINSTOR logs,
`dmesg`, versions of external tools used by LINSTOR, `ip a`, database dump and many more).
These information are stored for each node in plain text in the resulting `.tar.gz` file.
