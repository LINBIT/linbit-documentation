== DRBD Volumes in Docker

indexterm:[Docker]This chapter describes DRBD in Docker via the usage
of the http://www.drbd.org/en/supported-projects/docker[DRBD Manage Docker Volume Plugin].

[[s-docker-overview]]
=== Docker Overview

https://www.docker.com/[Docker] is a flexible and open source platform to build, ship, and run distributed
applications (a.k.a Linux Containers) for developers and sysadmins.

'drbdmange-docker-volume' is a daemon that is usually socket-activated by
'systemd'. It reads http commands from a local socket and manages
DRBD Manage resources that are replicated via DRBD.

[[s-docker-install]]
=== Docker Plugin Installation

There are essentially three different ways to install the DRBD Manage Docker Volume plugin:

- Via LINBIT's https://launchpad.net/~linbit/+archive/ubuntu/linbit-drbd9-stack[PPA]
- From http://www.drbd.org/en/supported-projects/docker[Source] via `make && sudo make install`
- By building propper packages (`make deb` or `make rpm`).

If you use the PPA or build propper packages, these packages contain a dependency on DRBD Manage in the
correct version. If you install from Source, make sure that DRBD Manage itself, and of course Docker, are installed.

The plugin is not enabled by default, to do so, execute  the following commands:

----------------------------
# systemctl enable docker-drbdmanage-plugin.socket
# systemctl start docker-drbdmanage-plugin.socket
----------------------------

Before you can make use of the plugin, make sure you configured a DRBD Manage cluster as described in
<<ch-admin-drbdmanage>>.

[[s-some_examples]]
=== Some examples
Here we show a typical example how Docker volumes backed by DRBD are used:

On node alpha:

----------------------------
# docker volume create -d drbdmanage --name=dmvol \
                       --opt fs=xfs --opt size=200
# docker run -ti --name=cont \
  		 -v dmvol:/data --volume-driver=drbdmanage busybox sh
# root@cont: echo "foo" > /data/test.txt
# root@cont: exit
# docker rm cont
----------------------------

And then on node bravo:

----------------------------
# docker run -ti --name=cont \
  		 -v dmvol:/data --volume-driver=drbdmanage busybox sh
# root@cont: cat /data/test.txt
  foo
# root@cont: exit
# docker rm cont
# docker volume rm dmvol
----------------------------
