This guide is intended to serve users of the software-defined storage (SDS) solution
LINSTOR(R) as a definitive reference guide and handbook.

It is being made available to the DRBD community by

charge and in the hope that it will be useful. The guide is
constantly being updated.  We try to add information
about new DRBD features simultaneously with the corresponding DRBD
releases. An on-line HTML version of this guide is always available at
