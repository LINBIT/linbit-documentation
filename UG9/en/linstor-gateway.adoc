== LINSTOR Gateway for Highly Available NFS, iSCSI, or NVMe-oF Storage

*LINSTOR Gateway* manages highly available NVMe-oF targets, iSCSI targets, and NFS exports by leveraging both
LINSTOR(R) and DRBD Reactor.

[[s-linstor-gateway-requirements]]
=== LINSTOR Gateway Requirements

Before you can use LINSTOR Gateway, you will need to have an initialized LINSTOR cluster, with DRBD Reactor, and NVMe-oF, NFS, iSCSI utilities
installed and configured. The following sections detail how to meet these requirements.

==== LINSTOR Cluster

The LINSTOR cluster needs to be set up as a prerequisite to using LINSTOR Gateway. For more detail regarding
LINSTOR's configuration options, refer to the
https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/LINSTOR-guide-1_0-en/#s-storage_pools[_LINSTOR User's Guide_].

For NVMe-oF, iSCSI, and NFS, a LINSTOR storage pool, resource group`, and volume group for LINSTOR Gateway need to be
created before use. The following section provides example commands for setting up the prerequisites in a three-node
LINSTOR cluster.

Create a LVM backed storage pool on each node using the physical device `/dev/sdb`:

----
# linstor physical-storage create-device-pool
          --pool-name lvpool LVM LINSTOR1 /dev/sdb --storage-pool lvmpool
# linstor physical-storage create-device-pool
          --pool-name lvpool LVM LINSTOR2 /dev/sdb --storage-pool lvmpool
# linstor physical-storage create-device-pool
          --pool-name lvpool LVM LINSTOR3 /dev/sdb --storage-pool lvmpool
----

Create resource groups and volume groups backed by the storage pool created in the previous command:

----
# linstor resource-group create iscsi_group --storage-pool lvmpool --place-count 2
# linstor resource-group create nfs_group --storage-pool lvmpool --place-count 3
# linstor resource-group create nvme_group --storage-pool lvm --place-count 2
----

----
# linstor volume-group create iscsi_group
# linstor volume-group create nfs_group
# linstor volume-group create nvmeof_group
----

LINSTOR Gateway requires modification of the LINSTOR satellite's configuration on each satellite node.
Edit or create the following file using your preferred text editor:

----
# vim /etc/linstor/linstor_satellite.toml
----

Add the following content to the satellite configuration:

----
[files]
  allowExtFiles = [
    "/etc/systemd/system",
    "/etc/systemd/system/linstor-satellite.service.d",
    "/etc/drbd-reactor.d"
  ]
----

Save the changes to the satellite configuration and restart the satellite service on all nodes to load the changes.

----
# systemctl restart linstor-satellite
----

[[s-linstor-gateway-drbd-reactor]]
==== Using DRBD Reactor to Create Highly Available LINSTOR Gateway Resources

DRBD Reactor is a daemon that will orchestrate the iSCSI, NFS or NVMe-oF resources in the LINSTOR Gateway cluster. It must be installed
and the service must be enabled on all nodes in the cluster.

DRBD Reactor's main function could be summarized as such:
Each DRBD Reactor daemon tries to take over DRBD Reactor managed services. The daemon that wins the race prevents other
nodes from activating the services until the original winner is no longer able to. When that happens, a new winner will
take over DRBD Reactor managed services, therefore achieving
high availability.

For details regarding DRBD Reactor's installation and configuration options, refer to the
link:https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/drbd-guide-9_0-en/#ch-drbd-reactor[DRBD Reactor chapter
in the _DRBD(R) User's Guide_]. The open source code for the project is hosted at the
link:https://github.com/LINBIT/drbd-reactor[project's GitHub repository]. The instructions that
follow assume that you have installed DRBD Reactor by using a package manager. Instructions
might vary for an installation from the GitHub project. Refer to the `README` file and other
documentation at the GitHub repository for details.

===== Enabling and Starting the DRBD Reactor Service

After installing DRBD Reactor on all your cluster nodes, start and enable the DRBD Reactor service on all nodes:

----
# systemctl enable --now drbd-reactor
----

===== Configuring DRBD Reactor to Automatically Reload Following Configuration Changes

Besides enabling and starting the DRBD Reactor service on all nodes, you also need to configure
DRBD Reactor to automatically reload when its configuration changes. To do this, enter the following command on all nodes:

----
# cp /usr/share/doc/drbd-reactor/drbd-reactor-reload.{path,service} /etc/systemd/system/
# systemctl enable --now drbd-reactor-reload.path
----

===== Installing the Open Cluster Framework Resource Agents

DRBD Reactor uses Open Cluster Framework (OCF) resource
agents when integrated with LINSTOR Gateway. You need to install these resource agents on all nodes in the cluster. To do this, use a package manager to install the `resource-agents` package (in both RPM and DEB based distributions).

==== NVME-oF, iSCSI, and NFS Utilities

To configure NVMe-oF targets for LINSTOR Gateway, you will need to install the NVMe-of command line interface on
all nodes.

On RPM based systems, install the `nvmetcli` package. On DEB based systems, install the `nvme-cli` package.

===== Selecting and Installing the iSCSI Stack and Dependencies

LINSTOR Gateway can use either the Linux-IO (LIO) or the Generic SCSI Target Subsystem for Linux (SCST) for an iSCSI implementation.

LIO is the iSCSI implementation that the Linux kernel community chose as the
SCSI target subsystem that is included in the mainline Linux kernel.

SCST is a mature iSCSI implementation that is used in many iSCSI appliances,
including the LINBIT(R)-developed VSAN solution since version 0.17.0.

====== Option A: LIO

TargetCLI is an interactive shell used to manage the LIO target. LIO
is the SCSI target that has been included with the Linux kernel since 2.6.38, which
makes the installation of its utilities and dependencies relatively simple.

You can install TargetCLI by using a package manager to install the `targetcli` package on RPM-based systems, or the `targetcli-fb` package on DEB-based systems.

====== Option B: SCST

The SCST project consists of a kernel space core, device handlers, target
drivers, and the `scstadmin` user space utility for managing its core
components. All of which can be built from source, by following the
instructions found on the project's
link:https://github.com/SCST-project/scst/blob/master/INSTALL.md[GitHub repository].

By following the installation instructions below, you will install all the necessary components
for using SCST with LINSTOR Gateway.

IMPORTANT: Enter and run all the commands in this section on all nodes. The instructions below are for installations on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Adjustments will be needed to install and configure SCST on DEB based systems.

ELRepo, the RPM repository for Enterprise Linux packages that are not included
in the standard RHEL distribution's repositories, is needed for installing
DKMS. Development tools and other dependencies for building SCST's RPMs must
also be installed:

----
# dnf install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm
# dnf groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
# dnf install -y kernel-devel perl perl-Data-Dumper perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker rpm-build dkms git
----

After installing build dependencies, you can build and install the SCST packages:

----
# git clone https://github.com/SCST-project/scst
# cd scst/
# make rpm-dkms
# cd ~/
# dnf install -y /usr/src/packages/RPMS/x86_64/scst*
----

Finally, enter the commands below to create the necessary configuration for loading the SCST kernel
module, create a systemd unit file for an `iscs-scst` service, and reload systemd services:

----
# echo -n "" > /etc/modules-load.d/scst.conf
# for m in iscsi-scst scst scst_vdisk; do
    echo $m >> /etc/modules-load.d/scst.conf
    modprobe $m
  done

# cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/iscsi-scst.service
[Unit]
Description=iSCSI SCST Target Daemon
Documentation=man:iscsi-scstd(8)
After=network.target
Before=scst.service
Conflicts=shutdown.target

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/scst
PIDFile=/var/run/iscsi-scstd.pid
ExecStartPre=/sbin/modprobe iscsi-scst
ExecStart=/sbin/iscsi-scstd $ISCSID_OPTIONS

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl enable --now iscsi-scst
----

===== NFS Support in LINSTOR Gateway

For NFS support in LINSTOR Gateway, you need to install NFS utilities on all cluster nodes.

Install the `nfs-utils` package on RPM based systems or the `nfs-common` package on DEB based systems.

The NFS server service should not be enabled in systemd since that will conflict with DRBD Reactor's ability to manage the
service. Disable the `nfs-server` service and verify that it has been disabled using the following commands:

----
# systemctl disable nfs-server --now
# systemctl status nfs-server
----

Verify that the output of the `status` command above lists the service as `inactive` and `disabled`:

----
‚óè nfs-server.service - NFS server and services
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nfs-server.service; disabled; ..snip..)
   Active: inactive (dead)
----

[[s-linstor-gateway-installing]]
=== Installing LINSTOR Gateway

After verifying that prerequisites are installed and configured, you can install LINSTOR
Gateway.

If you are a LINBIT customer, you can install LINSTOR Gateway by using your package manager to
install the `linstor-gateway` package from LINBIT customer repositories. LINBIT maintains the
open source LINSTOR Gateway code at the project's
link:https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-gateway/releases[GitHub page].

IMPORTANT: LINSTOR Gateway communicates with the LINSTOR controller by using the LINSTOR client. For this reason, LINSTOR Gateway should be installed where a LINSTOR client is configured to communicate with a LINSTOR controller for the LINSTOR cluster. For more information on link:https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/linstor-guide-1_0-en/#s-linstor_ha[configuring a LINSTOR client see the _LINSTOR User's Guide_].

[[s-linstor-gateway-installing-server-component]]
==== Installing the LINSTOR Gateway Server Component

LINSTOR Gateway has a server component which needs to be running in the background on a node
that the LINSTOR client is installed on in your cluster. Usually this will be your LINSTOR
controller node, although it could be installed on multiple nodes in your cluster, if for
example, you have configured a
link:https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/linstor-guide-1_0-en/#s-linstor_ha[highly available
LINSTOR controller]. 
However, you do not need to run the LINSTOR client on the same node as the LINSTOR controller, as long as the LINSTOR client on your LINSTOR Gateway server "knows" how to reach the LINSTOR controller, for example, by using a `controllers=` line in your LINSTOR client configuration file (`/etc/linstor/linstor-client.conf`).

To install the LINSTOR Gateway server on a node, you will use a systemd service.
Create the file `/etc/systemd/system/linstor-gateway.service` **on the
same node as your LINSTOR client** and copy the following content into it to create the service:

----
[Unit]
Description=LINSTOR Gateway
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/linstor-gateway server --addr ":8080"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

Next, start and enable the LINSTOR Gateway service:

```
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl enable --now linstor-gateway
```

[[s-linstor-gateway-verification]]
=== Verifying Requirements Are Satisfied

As a final step before starting to use LINSTOR Gateway, verify that you have satisfied the prerequisites outlined
in the previous sections.

==== Verifying Components Are Installed

The following instructions for verifying LINSTOR Gateway components assume that you already installed and
configured a LINSTOR cluster complete with storage pools, resource groups, and volume groups before using
LINSTOR Gateway.

In addition to the initialized LINSTOR cluster, the following packages need to be present on all nodes:

* `linstor-client`
* `drbd-reactor`
* `nvmetcli`
* `targetcli` (RPM) or `targetcli-fb` (DEB), if you are using LIO for an iSCSI implementation
* `nfs-utils` (RPM) or `nfs-common` (DEB)
* `nfs-server` (RPM) or `nfs-kernel-server` (DEB)
* `resource-agents`

LINSTOR Gateway provides a utility to check that the prerequisite tools are present on the node that you run the command from. To use this tool, enter the following command on your LINSTOR controller node:

----
# linstor-gateway check-health
----

This command should print something similar to the output below if you installed all of the required components. If an
error is reported, you must resolve the error before proceeding.

----
[‚úì] LINSTOR
[‚úì] drbd-reactor
[‚úì] Resource Agents
[‚úì] iSCSI
[‚úì] NVMe-oF
[‚úì] NFS
----

==== Verifying LINSTOR Cluster Initialization

Verify that the LINSTOR cluster is initialized properly by comparing your outputs are similar to the outputs in the
commands below.

Verify that all your LINSTOR nodes are listed as a satellite or combined type, and that you have three (or more) nodes to support
quorum:

[[s-linstor-gateway-create-iscsi]]
=== Creating iSCSI Targets

Once the preparations are complete, you can start creating iSCSI LUNs. The `linstor-gateway` command line utility will
be used to manage all iSCSI related actions. 

TIP: Use `linstor-gateway iscsi help` for detailed information regarding the `iscsi` subcommand.

The following command will create a new DRBD resource in the LINSTOR cluster with the specified name and resource-group.
This command also creates the DRBD Reactor configuration files to enable high availability of the iSCSI target.

----
# linstor-gateway iscsi create iqn.2019-08.com.linbit:example 192.168.122.181/24 1G \
                        --username=foo --password=bar --resource-group=iscsi_group
----

After running the command above, you will have a 1GiB iSCSI target with CHAP authentication enabled using the username and
password provided. It will be discoverable on the IP address provided in the command. The target will be backed by a
DRBD device managed by LINSTOR. The DRBD resource was created by LINSTOR in the `iscsi_group` resource-group. The DRBD
Reactor configuration files created by the above command can be found in `/etc/drbd-reactor.d/`.

You can list LINSTOR Gateway created iSCSI resources using the `linstor-gateway iscsi list` command:

=== Deleting iSCSI Targets

The following command will delete the iSCSI target from DRBD Reactor and the LINSTOR cluster:

----
# linstor-gateway delete -i iqn.2021-04.com.linbit:lun4 -l 4

=== Creating NFS Exports

Before creating a NFS export you need to tell LINSTOR which file system the DRBD resource should be formatted with.
This is done by setting the `FileSystem/Type` property on the resource-group created for NFS exports. Use
the following LINSTOR command to do so:

----
# linstor resource-group set-property nfs_group FileSystem/Type ext4
----

TIP: You only need to set this once per resource-group, and only on the resource-group created specifically for LINSTOR
Gateway's NFS exports.

Finally, the following command will create a HA NFS export in the cluster. This single command will create a new resource within
the LINSTOR cluster using the specified name and resource-group. This command also creates the DRBD Reactor configuration
files to enable high availability of the NFS export.

----
# linstor-gateway nfs create nfstest 172.16.16.102/32 1G \
                  --allowed-ips=172.16.16.0/24 --resource-group=nfs_group
----

After running the command above, you will have a 1GiB NFS export with the specified `allowed-ips` able to mount the export
using the IP address specified as the `--service-ip`. The exports will be backed by a DRBD device managed by LINSTOR.
The DRBD resource was created by LINSTOR in the `nfs_group` resource-group. The DRBD Reactor configuration files created
by the above command can be found in `/etc/drbd-reactor.d/`.

You can list LINSTOR Gateway created NFS resources using the `linstor-gateway nfs list` command:

----
# LINSTOR-gateway nfs list
+----------+------------------+---------------+------------------------------+---------------+
| Resource |    Service IP    | Service state |          NFS export          | LINSTOR state |
+----------+------------------+---------------+------------------------------+---------------+
| nfstest  | 172.16.16.102/32 | Started       | /srv/gateway-exports/nfstest | OK            |
+----------+------------------+---------------+------------------------------+---------------+
----

TIP: You can check the DRBD Reactor status using the `drbd-reactorctl status` command.

[[s-linstor-gateway-delete-nfs]]
=== Deleting NFS Exports

The following command will delete the NFS export from DRBD Reactor and the LINSTOR cluster:

----
# linstor-gateway nfs delete -r nfstest
----

=== Creating NVMe-oF Targets

The `linstor-gateway` command line utility will be used to manage all NVMe-oF target related actions.

TIP: Use `linstor-gateway nvme help` for detailed information regarding the `nvme` subcommand.

The following command will create a new DRBD resource in the LINSTOR cluster with the specified name and resource group.
This command also creates the DRBD Reactor configuration files to enable high availability of the NVMe-oF target.

----
# linstor-gateway nvme create linbit:nvme:vol0 192.168.221.69/24 2G
----

After running the command above, you will have a highly available 2GiB NVMe-oF target created in your cluster that is discoverable
on the IP address used in the command. The target will be backed by a DRBD device managed by LINSTOR. The DRBD resource
was created by LINSTOR in the `nvmeof_group` resource group. The DRBD Reactor configuration files created by the above
command can be found in `/etc/drbd-reactor.d/`.

You can list the NVMe-oF resources that you created by using LINSTOR Gateway by entering the `linstor-gateway nvme list` command:

----
# linstor-gateway nvme list
+------------------+-------------------+---------------+-----------+---------------+
|       NQN        |    Service IP     | Service state | Namespace | LINSTOR state |
+------------------+-------------------+---------------+-----------+---------------+
| linbit:nvme:vol0 | 192.168.221.69/24 | Started       |         1 | OK            |
+------------------+-------------------+---------------+-----------+---------------+
----

TIP: You can check the DRBD Reactor status using the `drbd-reactorctl status` command.
