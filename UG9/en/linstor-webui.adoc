== LINSTOR GUI

LINSTOR GUI is a LINSTOR client alternative, currently in Technology
Preview phase. This component is proprietary and users need to have access to LINBIT customer-only
repositories to be able to use it.

=== Prerequisites
* Access to LINBIT's customer repositories.
* Running and working LINSTOR controller instance.

=== Installing the LINSTOR GUI
Install LINSTOR GUI package on the same node as the LINSTOR controller and restart the `linstor-controller` service.

On `yum/dnf` based distributions you can install the software by entering the command:

[source,bash]
----
yum install linstor-gui
----

On `apt` based distributions you install the software by entering the command:

[source,bash]
----
apt install linstor-gui
----

On Kubernetes, LINSTOR GUI is a built-in feature since linstor-controller v1.15.0.

=== Administering the LINSTOR Cluster
Open your web browser and navigate to `http://CONTROLLER_IP:3370/ui/` (the last `/` is mandatory) to manage your LINSTOR cluster.
