//== Architecture of a Cluster

LINSTOR – and by extension LINSTOR Gateway – clusters can come in a variety of sizes and
implementations, depending on the circumstances of the surrounding environment and the intended
use cases.

This chapter outlines some considerations to take into account when designing and planning a
LINSTOR Gateway cluster.

Depending on the architecture of the cluster, there might be multiple instances of the
LINSTOR Gateway server software or only one.
There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. These are the routes you can take:

1. *Only one LINSTOR Gateway server*: This is the simplest setup. If the LINSTOR controller software always runs on the same node, it makes sense to place the LINSTOR Gateway server on that same node. +
The advantage of this approach is that the LINSTOR Gateway server will need no further configuration to find the LINSTOR controller. +
The disadvantage is that you will need to configure your LINSTOR Gateway client so that it finds the LINSTOR Gateway server.
2. *Multiple LINSTOR Gateway servers*: If your LINSTOR controller can move between nodes (for example, because you made it highly available by using DRBD Reactor), it can be beneficial to run a LINSTOR Gateway server on every node where the LINSTOR Controller could potentially run.
