"LINSTOR Gateway supports different storage transport protocols.  This "

"might use one over the other."

"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7143[iSCSI] is a transport protocol "
"that allows SCSI traffic to be sent via TCP.  The standard has seen wide use "
"since its inception in the early 2000s, so it has often been viewed as the "
"\"default choice\" for network-attached storage."

"https://nvmexpress.org/developers/nvme-of-specification/[NVMe over Fabrics] "

"Linux kernel support for NVMe over Fabrics targets is -- generally speaking "

"Rather than transmitting block-level data over the network, NFS is a "
