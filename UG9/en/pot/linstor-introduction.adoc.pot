"LINSTOR is an open source configuration management system, developed by "
"LINBIT(R) for storage on Linux systems. It manages LVM logical volumes, ZFS "
"ZVOLs, or both, on a cluster of nodes. It uses DRBD(R) for replication "
"between different nodes and to provide block storage devices to users and "
"applications. Some of its features include snapshots, encryption, and "
"caching of HDD backed data in SSDs."

"A working LINSTOR setup requires one active controller node that runs the "

"The setup also requires one or more satellite nodes that run the LINSTOR "
"satellite software as a systemd service, `linstor-satellite.service`. The "
"LINSTOR satellite service facilitates storage and related actions on the "

"and applications. However, satellite nodes do not have to provide physical "
"storage to the cluster. For example, you can have _diskless_ satellite nodes "
