"LINBIT(R) VSAN is a software-defined storage solution for hyperconverged "

"drbd[DRBD(R)] and link:https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-server[LINSTOR(R)] "
"open source software.  It uses AlmaLinux 8 as a foundation and uses software "

"In practice, VSAN runs one of its instances as a virtual machine on each "
"hypervisor in the cluster.  The hypervisor passes its local storage through "
"to VSAN, which then replicates the storage's data across the cluster.  One "
"of the VSAN virtual machines exports an iSCSI target through a static IP.  "
"This iSCSI target can be fed back to the hypervisor to offer a highly "
"available datastore.  The resulting datastore can be used to store virtual "
"machines and disk images on solid, redundant storage."
