"The Oracle Cluster File System, version 2 (OCFS2) is a concurrent access "
"shared storage file system developed by Oracle Corporation. Unlike its "
"predecessor OCFS, which was specifically designed and only suitable for "
"Oracle database payloads, OCFS2 is a general-purpose filesystem that "
"implements most POSIX semantics. The most common use case for OCFS2 is "
"arguably Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC), but OCFS2 may also be used "
"for load-balanced NFS clusters, for example."

"Although originally designed for use with conventional shared storage "
"devices, OCFS2 is equally well suited to be deployed on <<s-dual-primary-"
"mode,dual-Primary DRBD>>. Applications reading from the filesystem may "
"benefit from reduced read latency due to the fact that DRBD reads from and "
"writes to local storage, as opposed to the SAN devices OCFS2 otherwise "
"normally runs on. In addition, DRBD adds redundancy to OCFS2 by adding an "
"additional copy to every filesystem image, as opposed to just a single "
"filesystem image that is merely shared."

msgid ""
"Like other shared cluster file systems such as <<ch-gfs,GFS>>, OCFS2 allows "
"multiple nodes to access the same storage device, in read/write mode, "
"simultaneously without risking data corruption. It does so by using a "
"Distributed Lock Manager (DLM) which manages concurrent access from cluster "
"nodes. The DLM itself uses a virtual file system (`ocfs2_dlmfs`) which is "
"separate from the actual OCFS2 file systems present on the system."
