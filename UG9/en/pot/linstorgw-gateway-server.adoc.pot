"You can omit the second rule because the only possible node that the LINSTOR "

"This setup is very simple to implement, but it has an important drawback: "
"the LINSTOR controller on `node-1` is the single point of failure for the "
"cluster's _control plane_.  If `node-1` were to go offline, you would lose "
"the ability to control the storage in your cluster."

"It is important to distinguish between the _control plane_ and the _data "
