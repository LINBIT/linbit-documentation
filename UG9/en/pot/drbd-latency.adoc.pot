"DRBD allows you to set an explicit CPU mask for its kernel threads. By "

"resource run on this CPU. This policy is generally optimal when the goal is "
"maximum aggregate performance with more DRBD resources than CPU cores. If "
"instead you want to maximize the performance of individual resources at the "
"cost of total CPU usage, you can use the CPU mask parameter to allow the "
"DRBD threads to use multiple CPUs."

"In addition, for detailed fine-tuning, you can coordinate the placement of "
