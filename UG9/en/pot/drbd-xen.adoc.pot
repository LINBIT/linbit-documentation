"Xen is a virtualization framework originally developed at the University of "

"Xen uses paravirtualization — a virtualization method involving a high "
"degree of cooperation between the virtualization host and guest virtual "
"machines — with selected guest operating systems for improved performance in "
"comparison to conventional virtualization solutions (which are typically "
"based on hardware emulation). Xen also supports full hardware emulation on "
"CPUs that support the appropriate virtualization extensions; in Xen "
"parlance, this is known as HVM ( \"hardware-assisted virtual machine\")."

"(as in non-virtual DRBD deployment scenarios), but also for any other "
"operating system that can run virtually under Xen — which, in essence, "
"includes any operating system available on 32- or 64-bit Intel compatible "
