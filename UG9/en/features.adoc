[[ch-features]]
== DRBD Features

This chapter discusses various useful DRBD features, and gives some
background information about them. Some of these features will be
important to most users, some will only be relevant in very specific
deployment scenarios. <<p-work>> and <<ch-troubleshooting>> contain
instructions on how to enable and use these features in day-to-day
operation.

[[s-single-primary-mode]]
===  Single-primary mode

In single-primary mode, a resource is, at any given
time, in the primary role on only one cluster member. Since it is
guaranteed that only one cluster node manipulates the data at any
moment, this mode can be used with any conventional file system (ext3,
ext4, XFS etc.).

Deploying DRBD in single-primary mode is the canonical approach for
High-Availability (fail-over capable) clusters.

[[s-dual-primary-mode]]
=== Dual-primary mode

In dual-primary mode, a resource is, at any given time, in the
primary role on two cluster nodesfootnote:[Perhaps that feature
will be renamed to "Multi Primary" later on, when it actually
works ;)]. Since concurrent access to the
data is thus possible, this mode requires the use of a shared cluster
file system that utilizes a distributed lock manager. Examples include
<<ch-gfs,GFS>> and <<ch-ocfs2,OCFS2>>.

Deploying DRBD in dual-primary mode is the preferred approach for
load-balancing clusters which require concurrent data access from two
nodes, e.g. virtualization environments with a need for live-migration.
This mode is disabled by default, and must be enabled
explicitly in DRBD's configuration file.

See <<s-enable-dual-primary>> for information on enabling dual-primary
mode for specific resources.

[[s-replication-protocols]]
=== Replication modes

DRBD supports three distinct replication modes, allowing three degrees
of replication synchronicity.

[[fp-protocol-a]]
.Protocol A
Asynchronous replication protocol. Local write operations on the
primary node are considered completed as soon as the local disk write
has finished, and the replication packet has been placed in the local
TCP send buffer. In the event of forced fail-over, data loss may
occur. The data on the standby node is consistent after fail-over;
however, the most recent updates performed prior to the crash could be
lost. Protocol A is most often used in long distance replication scenarios.
When used in combination with DRBD Proxy it makes an effective
disaster recovery solution. See <<s-drbd-proxy>>, for more information.


[[fp-protocol-b]]
.Protocol B
Memory synchronous (semi-synchronous) replication protocol. Local
write operations on the primary node are considered completed as soon
as the local disk write has occurred, and the replication packet has
reached the peer node. Normally, no writes are lost in case of forced
fail-over. However, in the event of simultaneous power failure on both
nodes *and* concurrent, irreversible destruction of the primary's data
store, the most recent writes completed on the primary may be lost.

[[fp-protocol-c]]
.Protocol C
Synchronous replication protocol. Local write operations on the
primary node are considered completed only after both the local and
the remote disk write(s) have been confirmed. As a result, loss of a
single node is guaranteed not to lead to any data loss. Data loss is,
of course, inevitable even with this replication protocol if all
nodes (resp. their storage subsystems) are irreversibly destroyed at the
same time.

By far, the most commonly used replication protocol in DRBD setups is
protocol C.

The choice of replication protocol influences two factors of your
deployment: _protection_ and _latency_. _Throughput_, by contrast, is
largely independent of the replication protocol selected.

See <<s-configure-resource>> for an example resource configuration
which demonstrates replication protocol configuration.

[[s-multi-node]]
=== More than 2-way redundancy

With DRBD 9 it's possible to have the data stored simultaneously on more than
two cluster nodes.

While this has been possible before via <<s-three-way-repl,stacking>>, in
DRBD 9 this is supported out-of-the-box for (currently) up to 16 nodes.
(In practice, using 3-, 4- or perhaps 5-way redundancy via DRBD
will make other things the leading cause of downtime.)

The major difference to the stacking solution is that there's less performance
loss, because only one level of data replication is being used.

// E.g. if availability for a single node is 99%, for two nodes it might
// be 99.99%, for three nodes 99.999%

[[s-automatic-promotion]]
=== Automatic Promotion of Resources

Prior to DRBD 9, promoting a resource would be done with the `drbdadm primary` command. With DRBD
9, DRBD will automatically promote a resource to primary role when the `auto-promote`
option is enabled, and one of its volumes is
mounted or opened for writing. As soon as all volumes are unmounted or closed, the role
of the resource changes back to secondary.

Automatic promotion will only succeed if the cluster state allows it (that is, if an
explicit `drbdadm primary` command would succeed). Otherwise, mounting or opening
the device fails as it did prior to DRBD 9.


[[s-replication-transports]]
=== Multiple replication transports
DRBD supports multiple network transports. As of now two transport
implementations are available: TCP and RDMA. Each transport implementation
comes as its own kernel module.

[[s-tcp_transport]]
==== TCP Transport
The `drbd_transport_tcp.ko` transport
implementation is included with the distribution files of drbd itself.
As the name implies, this transport implementation uses the TCP/IP
protocol to move data between machines.

DRBD's replication and synchronization framework socket layer supports
multiple low-level transports:

.TCP over IPv4
This is the canonical implementation, and DRBD's default. It may be
used on any system that has IPv4 enabled.

.TCP over IPv6
When configured to use standard TCP sockets for replication and
synchronization, DRBD can use also IPv6 as its network protocol. This
is equivalent in semantics and performance to IPv4, albeit using a
different addressing scheme.

.SDP
SDP is an implementation of BSD-style sockets for RDMA capable
transports such as InfiniBand. SDP was available as part of the OFED
stack of most distributions but is now *considered deprecated*. SDP uses an IPv4-style
addressing scheme. Employed over an InfiniBand interconnect, SDP
provides a high-throughput, low-latency replication network to DRBD.

.SuperSockets
SuperSockets replace the TCP/IP portions of the stack with a single,
monolithic, highly efficient and RDMA capable socket
implementation. DRBD can use this socket type for very low latency
replication. SuperSockets must run on specific hardware which is
currently available from a single vendor, Dolphin Interconnect
Solutions.

[[s-rdma_transport]]
==== RDMA Transport
Alternatively the `drbd_transport_rdma.ko` kernel module is available from LINBIT. This
transport uses the verbs/RDMA API to move data over InfiniBand HCAs,
iWARP capable NICs or RoCE capable NICs. In contrast to the BSD sockets
API (used by TCP/IP) the verbs/RDMA API allows data movement with very
little CPU involvement.

[[s-conclusion]]
==== Conclusion

At high transfer rates it might be possible that the CPU load/memory
bandwidth of the tcp transport becomes the limiting factor. You can
probably achieve higher transfer rates using the rdma transport with
appropriate hardware.

A transport implementation can be configured for each connection of a
resource. See <<s-configuring-transports>> for more details.

[[s-resync]]
=== Efficient synchronization

(Re-)synchronization is distinct from device replication. While
replication occurs on any write event to a resource in the primary
role, synchronization is decoupled from incoming writes. Rather, it
affects the device as a whole.

Synchronization is necessary if the replication link has been
interrupted for any reason, be it due to failure of the primary node,
failure of the secondary node, or interruption of the replication
link. Synchronization is efficient in the sense that DRBD does not
synchronize modified blocks in the order they were originally written,
but in linear order, which has the following consequences:

* Synchronization is fast, since blocks in which several successive
  write operations occurred are only synchronized once.

* Synchronization is also associated with few disk seeks, as blocks
  are synchronized according to the natural on-disk block layout.

* During synchronization, the data set on the standby node is partly
  obsolete and partly already updated. This state of data is called
  _inconsistent_.

The service continues to run uninterrupted on the active node, while
background synchronization is in progress.

IMPORTANT: A node with inconsistent data generally cannot be put into
operation, thus it is desirable to keep the time period during which a
node is inconsistent as short as possible. DRBD does, however, ship
with an LVM integration facility that automates the creation of LVM
snapshots immediately before synchronization. This ensures that a
_consistent_ copy of the data is always available on the peer, even
while synchronization is running. See <<s-lvm-snapshots>> for details
on using this facility.

[[s-variable-rate-sync]]
==== Variable-rate synchronization

In variable-rate synchronization (the default since 8.4), DRBD detects the
available bandwidth on the synchronization network, compares it to
incoming foreground application I/O, and selects an appropriate
synchronization rate based on a fully automatic control loop.

See <<s-configure-sync-rate-variable>> for configuration suggestions with
regard to variable-rate synchronization.

[[s-fixed_rate_synchronization]]
==== Fixed-rate synchronization

In fixed-rate synchronization, the amount of data shipped to the
synchronizing peer per second (the _synchronization rate_) has a
configurable, static upper limit. Based on this limit, you may
estimate the expected sync time based on the following simple formula:

[[eq-resync-time]]
[equation]
.Synchronization time
image::images/resync-time.svg[]


_t~sync~_ is the expected sync time. _D_ is the amount of data to be
synchronized, which you are unlikely to have any influence over (this
is the amount of data that was modified by your application while the
replication link was broken).  _R_ is the rate of synchronization,
which is configurable -- bounded by the throughput limitations of the
replication network and I/O subsystem.

See <<s-configure-sync-rate>> for configuration suggestions with
regard to fixed-rate synchronization.

[[s-checksum-sync]]
==== Checksum-based synchronization

[[p-checksum-sync]]
The efficiency of DRBD's synchronization algorithm may be further
enhanced by using data digests, also known as checksums. When using
checksum-based synchronization, then rather than performing a
brute-force overwrite of blocks marked out of sync, DRBD _reads_
blocks before synchronizing them and computes a hash of the contents
currently found on disk. It then compares this hash with one computed
from the same sector on the peer, and omits re-writing this block if
the hashes match. This can dramatically cut down synchronization times
in situation where a filesystem re-writes a sector with identical
contents while DRBD is in disconnected mode.

See <<s-configure-checksum-sync>> for configuration suggestions with
regard to synchronization.


[[s-suspended-replication]]
=== Suspended replication

If properly configured, DRBD can detect if the
replication network is congested, and _suspend_ replication in this
case. In this mode, the primary node "pulls ahead" of the secondary --
temporarily going out of sync, but still leaving a consistent copy on
the secondary. When more bandwidth becomes available, replication
automatically resumes and a background synchronization takes place.

Suspended replication is typically enabled over links with variable
bandwidth, such as wide area replication over shared connections
between data centers or cloud instances.

See <<s-configure-congestion-policy>> for details on congestion
policies and suspended replication.

[[s-online-verify]]
=== On-line device verification

On-line device verification enables users to do a block-by-block data
integrity check between nodes in a very efficient manner.

Note that _efficient_ refers to efficient use of network bandwidth
here, and to the fact that verification does not break redundancy in
any way. On-line verification is still a resource-intensive operation,
with a noticeable impact on CPU utilization and load average.

It works by one node (the _verification source_) sequentially
calculating a cryptographic digest of every block stored on the
lower-level storage device of a particular resource. DRBD then
transmits that digest to the peer node(s) (the _verification target(s)_),
where it is checked against a digest of the local copy of the affected
block. If the digests do not match, the block is marked out-of-sync
and may later be synchronized. Because DRBD transmits just the
digests, not the full blocks, on-line verification uses network
bandwidth very efficiently.

The process is termed _on-line_ verification because it does not
require that the DRBD resource being verified is unused at the time of
verification. Thus, though it does carry a slight performance penalty
while it is running, on-line verification does not cause service
interruption or system down time -- neither during the
verification run nor during subsequent synchronization.

It is a common use case to have on-line verification managed by the
local cron daemon, running it, for example, once a week or once a
month.  See <<s-use-online-verify>> for information on how to enable,
invoke, and automate on-line verification.

[[s-integrity-check]]
=== Replication traffic integrity checking

DRBD optionally performs end-to-end message integrity checking using
cryptographic message digest algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, or CRC-32C.

These message digest algorithms are *not* provided by DRBD, but by the Linux
kernel crypto API; DRBD merely uses them. Thus, DRBD is
capable of utilizing any message digest algorithm available in a
particular system's kernel configuration.

With this feature enabled, DRBD generates a message digest of every
data block it replicates to the peer, which the peer then uses to
verify the integrity of the replication packet. If the replicated
block can not be verified against the digest, the connection is dropped
and immediately re-established; because of the bitmap the typical result is a
retransmission. Thus, DRBD replication is protected against several
error sources, all of which, if unchecked, would potentially lead to
data corruption during the replication process:

* Bitwise errors ("bit flips") occurring on data in transit between
  main memory and the network interface on the sending node (which
  goes undetected by TCP checksumming if it is offloaded to the
  network card, as is common in recent implementations);

* Bit flips occurring on data in transit from the network interface to
  main memory on the receiving node (the same considerations apply for
  TCP checksum offloading);

* Any form of corruption due to a race conditions or bugs in network
  interface firmware or drivers;

* Bit flips or random corruption injected by some reassembling network
  component between nodes (if not using direct, back-to-back
  connections).

See <<s-configure-integrity-check>> for information on how to enable
replication traffic integrity checking.

[[s-split-brain-notification-and-recovery]]
===  Split brain notification and automatic recovery

Split brain is a situation where, due to temporary failure of all
network links between cluster nodes, and possibly due to intervention
by a cluster management software or human error, both nodes switched
to the _Primary_ role while disconnected. This is a potentially harmful
state, as it implies that modifications to the data might have been
made on either node, without having been replicated to the peer. Thus,
it is likely in this situation that two diverging sets of data have
been created, which cannot be trivially merged.

DRBD split brain is distinct from cluster split brain, which is the
loss of all connectivity between hosts managed by a distributed
cluster management application such as Pacemaker. To avoid confusion,
this guide uses the following convention:

* _Split brain_ refers to DRBD split brain as described in the
  paragraph above.

* Loss of all cluster connectivity is referred to as a _cluster
  partition_, an alternative term for cluster split brain.

DRBD allows for automatic operator notification (by email or other
means) when it detects split brain. See <<s-split-brain-notification>>
for details on how to configure this feature.

While the recommended course of action in this scenario is to
<<s-resolve-split-brain,manually resolve>> the split brain and then
eliminate its root cause, it may be desirable, in some cases, to
automate the process. DRBD has several resolution algorithms available
for doing so:

* *Discarding modifications made on the younger primary.* In this
  mode, when the network connection is re-established and split brain
  is discovered, DRBD will discard modifications made, in the
  meantime, on the node which switched to the primary role _last_.

* *Discarding modifications made on the older primary.* In this mode,
  DRBD will discard modifications made, in the meantime, on the node
  which switched to the primary role _first_.

* *Discarding modifications on the primary with fewer changes.* In
  this mode, DRBD will check which of the two nodes has recorded fewer
  modifications, and will then discard _all_ modifications made on
  that host.

* *Graceful recovery from split brain if one host has had no
  intermediate changes.* In this mode, if one of the hosts has made no
  modifications at all during split brain, DRBD will simply recover
  gracefully and declare the split brain resolved. Note that this is a
  fairly unlikely scenario. Even if both hosts only mounted the file
  system on the DRBD block device (even read-only), the device
  contents typically would be modified (e.g. by filesystem journal
  replay), ruling out the possibility of automatic
  recovery.

Whether or not automatic split brain recovery is acceptable depends
largely on the individual application.  Consider the example of DRBD
hosting a database. The discard modifications from host with fewer
changes approach may be fine for a web application click-through
database. By contrast, it may be totally unacceptable to automatically
discard _any_ modifications made to a financial database, requiring
manual recovery in any split brain event. Consider your application's
requirements carefully before enabling automatic split brain recovery.

Refer to <<s-automatic-split-brain-recovery-configuration>> for
details on configuring DRBD's automatic split brain recovery policies.

[[s-disk-flush-support]]
=== Support for disk flushes

When local block devices such as hard drives or RAID logical disks
have write caching enabled, writes to these devices are considered
completed as soon as they have reached the volatile cache. Controller
manufacturers typically refer to this as write-back mode, the opposite
being write-through. If a power outage occurs on a controller in
write-back mode, the last writes are never
committed to the disk, potentially causing data loss.

To counteract this, DRBD makes use of disk flushes. A disk flush is a
write operation that completes only when the associated data has been
committed to stable (non-volatile) storage -- that is to say, it has
effectively been written to disk, rather than to the cache. DRBD uses
disk flushes for write operations both to its replicated data set and
to its meta data. In effect, DRBD circumvents the write cache in
situations it deems necessary, as in <<s-activity-log,activity log>>
updates or enforcement of implicit write-after-write
dependencies. This means additional reliability even in the face of
power failure.

It is important to understand that DRBD can use disk flushes only when
layered on top of backing devices that support them.  Most reasonably
recent kernels support disk flushes for most SCSI and SATA
devices. Linux software RAID (md) supports disk flushes for RAID-1
provided that all component devices support them too. The same is true for
device-mapper devices (LVM2, dm-raid, multipath).

Controllers with battery-backed write cache (BBWC) use a battery to
back up their volatile storage. On such devices, when power is
restored after an outage, the controller flushes all pending writes out
to disk from the battery-backed cache, ensuring that all
writes committed to the volatile cache are actually transferred to
stable storage. When running DRBD on top of such devices, it may be
acceptable to disable disk flushes, thereby improving DRBD's write
performance. See <<s-disable-flushes>> for details.

[[s-trim-discard]]
=== Trim/Discard support

_Trim_/_Discard_ are two names for the same feature: a request to a storage
system, telling it that some data range is not being used anymorefootnote:[For
example, a deleted file's data.] and can get recycled. +
This call originates in Flash-based storages (SSDs, FusionIO cards, etc.),
which cannot easily _rewrite_ a sector but instead have to _erase_ and write
the (new) data again (incurring some latency cost). For more details, see e.g.
the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim_%28computing%29[wikipedia page].


Since 8.4.3 DRBD includes support for _Trim_/_Discard_. You don't need to configure
or enable anything; if DRBD detects that the local (underlying) storage system
allows using these commands, it will transparently enable them and pass such
requests through.

The effect is that e.g. a recent-enough `mkfs.ext4` on a multi-TB volume can
shorten the initial sync time to a few seconds to minutes - just by telling
DRBD (which will relay that information to all connected nodes) that most/all
of the storage is now to be seen as invalidated.

Nodes that connect to that resource later on will not have seen the
_Trim_/_Discard_ requests, and will therefore start a full resync; depending on
kernel version and file system a call to `fstrim` might give the wanted result,
though.

NOTE: even if you don't have storage with _Trim_/_Discard_ support, some
virtual block devices will provide you with the same feature, for example
Thin LVM.


[[s-handling-disk-errors]]
=== Disk error handling strategies

If a hard drive fails which is used as a backing block device for DRBD on one
of the nodes, DRBD may either pass on the I/O error to the upper
layer (usually the file system) or it can mask I/O errors from upper
layers.

[[fp-io-error-pass-on]]
.Passing on I/O errors
If DRBD is configured to pass on I/O errors, any such errors occurring
on the lower-level device are transparently passed to upper I/O
layers. Thus, it is left to upper layers to deal with such errors
(this may result in a file system being remounted read-only, for
example). This strategy does not ensure service continuity, and is
hence not recommended for most users.

[[fp-io-error-detach]]
.Masking I/O errors
If DRBD is configured to _detach_ on lower-level I/O error, DRBD will
do so, automatically, upon occurrence of the first lower-level I/O
error. The I/O error is masked from upper layers while DRBD
transparently fetches the affected block from a peer node, over the
network. From then onwards, DRBD is said to operate in diskless mode,
and carries out all subsequent I/O operations, read and write, on the
peer node(s) only. Performance in this mode will be reduced,
but the service continues without interruption, and can be moved to
the peer node in a deliberate fashion at a convenient time.

See <<s-configure-io-error-behavior>> for information on configuring
I/O error handling strategies for DRBD.

[[s-outdate]]
=== Strategies for dealing with outdated data

DRBD distinguishes between _inconsistent_ and _outdated_
data. Inconsistent data is data that cannot be expected to be
accessible and useful in any manner. The prime example for this is
data on a node that is currently the target of an on-going
synchronization. Data on such a node is part obsolete, part up to
date, and impossible to identify as either. Thus, for example, if the
device holds a filesystem (as is commonly the case), that filesystem
would be unexpected to mount or even pass an automatic filesystem
check.

Outdated data, by contrast, is data on a secondary node that is
consistent, but no longer in sync with the primary node. This would
occur in any interruption of the replication link, whether temporary
or permanent. Data on an outdated, disconnected secondary node is
expected to be clean, but it reflects a state of the peer node some
time past. In order to avoid services using outdated data, DRBD
disallows <<s-resource-roles,promoting a resource>> that
is in the outdated state.

DRBD has interfaces that allow an external application to outdate a
secondary node as soon as a network interruption occurs. DRBD will
then refuse to switch the node to the primary role, preventing
applications from using the outdated data. A complete implementation
of this functionality exists for the <<ch-pacemaker,Pacemaker cluster
management framework>> (where it uses a communication channel separate
from the DRBD replication link). However, the interfaces are generic
and may be easily used by any other cluster management application.

Whenever an outdated resource has its replication link re-established,
its outdated flag is automatically cleared. A <<s-resync,background
synchronization>> then follows.

[[s-three-way-repl]]
=== Three-way replication via stacking

NOTE: Available in DRBD version 8.3.0 and above; deprecated in DRBD version
9.x, as more nodes can be implemented on a single level. See
<<s-drbdconf-conns>> for details.

When using three-way replication, DRBD adds a third node to an
existing 2-node cluster and replicates data to that node, where it can
be used for backup and disaster recovery purposes. This type of
configuration generally involves <<s-drbd-proxy>>.

Three-way replication works by adding another, _stacked_ DRBD resource
on top of the existing resource holding your production data, as seen
in this illustration:

.DRBD resource stacking
image::images/drbd-resource-stacking.svg[]

The stacked resource is replicated using asynchronous replication
(DRBD protocol A), whereas the production data would usually make use
of synchronous replication (DRBD protocol C).

Three-way replication can be used permanently, where the third node is
continuously updated with data from the production
cluster. Alternatively, it may also be employed on demand, where the
production cluster is normally disconnected from the backup site, and
site-to-site synchronization is performed on a regular basis, for
example by running a nightly cron job.

[[s-drbd-proxy]]
=== Long-distance replication via DRBD Proxy

DRBD's <<s-replication-protocols,protocol A>> is asynchronous, but the
writing application will block as soon as the socket output buffer is
full (see the `sndbuf-size` option in the man page of `drbd.conf`). In that
event, the writing application has to wait until some of the data written
runs off through a possibly small bandwidth network link.

The average write bandwidth is limited by available bandwidth of the
network link. Write bursts can only be handled gracefully if they fit
into the limited socket output buffer.

You can mitigate this by DRBD Proxy's buffering mechanism.  DRBD Proxy
will place changed data from the DRBD device on the primary node into
its buffers. DRBD Proxy's buffer size is freely configurable, only
limited by the address room size and available physical RAM.

Optionally DRBD Proxy can be configured to compress and decompress the
data it forwards. Compression and decompression of DRBD's data packets
might slightly increase latency. However, when the bandwidth of the network
link is the limiting factor, the gain in shortening transmit time
outweighs the compression and decompression overhead.

Compression and decompression were implemented with multi core SMP
systems in mind, and can utilize multiple CPU cores.

The fact that most block I/O data compresses very well and therefore
the effective bandwidth increases justifies the use of the DRBD
Proxy even with DRBD protocols B and C.

See <<s-using-drbd-proxy>> for information on configuring DRBD Proxy.

NOTE: DRBD Proxy is one of the few parts of the DRBD product family that is
not published under an open source license. Please contact
sales@linbit.com or sales_us@linbit.com for an evaluation license.

[[s-truck-based-replication]]
=== Truck based replication

Truck based replication, also known as disk shipping, is a means of
preseeding a remote site with data to be replicated, by physically
shipping storage media to the remote site. This is particularly suited
for situations where

* the total amount of data to be replicated is fairly
  large (more than a few hundreds of gigabytes);

* the expected rate of change of the data to be replicated is less
  than enormous;

* the available network bandwidth between sites is
  limited.

In such situations, without truck based replication, DRBD would
require a very long initial device synchronization (on the order of
weeks, months, or years). Truck based replication allows to ship a data seed
to the remote site, and so drastically reduces the initial synchronization
time.  See <<s-using-truck-based-replication>> for details on this use
case.

[[s-floating-peers]]
=== Floating peers

NOTE: This feature is available in DRBD versions 8.3.2 and above.

A somewhat special use case for DRBD is the _floating peers_
configuration. In floating peer setups, DRBD peers are not tied to
specific named hosts (as in conventional configurations), but instead
have the ability to float between several hosts. In such a
configuration, DRBD identifies peers by IP address, rather than by
host name.

For more information about managing floating peer configurations, see
<<s-pacemaker-floating-peers>>.

[[s-rebalance]]
=== Data rebalancing (horizontal storage scaling)

If your company's policy says that 3-way redundancy is needed, you need
at least 3 servers for your setup.

Now, as your storage demands grow, you will encounter the need for
additional servers. Rather than having to buy 3 more servers at the same
time, you can _rebalance_ your data across a single additional node.

.DRBD data rebalancing
image::images/rebalance.svg[]

//[scaledwidth="75"]

In the figure above you can see the _before_ and _after_ states: from
3 nodes with three 25TiB volumes each (for a net 75TiB), to 4 nodes,
with net 100TiB.

DRBD 9 makes it possible to do an online, live migration of the data; please see
<<s-rebalance-workflow>> for the exact steps needed.

[[s-drbd-client]]
=== DRBD client

With the multiple-peer feature of DRBD a number of interesting use-cases have
been added, for example the _DRBD client_.

The basic idea is that the DRBD _backend_ can consist of 3, 4, or more nodes
(depending on the policy of required redundancy); but, as DRBD 9 can connect more
nodes than that. DRBD works then as a storage access protocol in addition to
storage replication.

All write requests executed on a primary _DRBD client_ gets shipped to all
nodes equipped with storage. Read requests are only shipped to one of the server
nodes. The _DRBD client_ will evenly distribute the read requests among all
available server nodes.

[[s-feature-quorum]]
=== Quorum

In order to avoid split brain or diverging data of replicas one has to configure
fencing. It turns out that in real world deployments node fencing is not popular
because often mistakes happen in planning or deploying it.

In the moment a data-set has 3 replicas one can rely on the quorum implementation
within DRBD instead of Pacemaker level fencing. Pacemaker gets informed about
quorum or loss-of-quorum via the master score of the resource.

DRBD's quorum can be used with any kind of Linux based service. In case the
service terminates in the moment it is exposed to an IO-error the on quorum
loss behavior is very elegant.
In case the service does not terminate upon IO-error the systems needs to
be configured to reboot a primary node that looses quorum.

See <<s-configuring-quorum>> for more information.

[[s-feature-quorum-tiebreaker]]
==== Tiebreaker

[NOTE]
====================
The quorum tiebreaker feature is available in DRBD versions 9.0.18 and above.
====================

The fundamental problem with two node clusters is that in the moment they lose
connectivity we have two partitions and none of them has quorum, which results
in the cluster halting the service. This problem can be mitigated by adding a
third, diskless node to the cluster which will then act as a quorum tiebreaker.

See <<s-configuring-quorum-tiebreaker>> for more information.

[[s-feature-VCS]]
=== DRBD integration for VCS

Veritas Cluster Server (or Veritas Infoscale Availability) is a commercial alternative
