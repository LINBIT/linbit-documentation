== An introduction to LINSTOR

To use LINSTOR(R) effectively, this "Introduction to LINSTOR" chapter provides an overview of the
software, explains how it works and deploys storage, and introduces and explains important
concepts and terms to help your understanding.

=== An overview of LINSTOR

LINSTOR is an open source configuration management system, developed by LINBIT(R) for storage on
Linux systems. It manages LVM logical volumes, ZFS ZVOLs, or both, on a cluster of nodes. It
uses DRBD(R) for replication between different nodes and to provide block storage devices to
users and applications. Some of its features include snapshots, encryption, and caching of HDD
backed data in SSDs.

[[s-broader_context]]
==== Where LINSTOR is used

LINSTOR was originally developed to manage DRBD resources. While you can still use LINSTOR to
make managing DRBD more convenient, LINSTOR has evolved and it is often integrated with software
stacks higher up to provide persistent storage more easily and more flexibly than would
otherwise be possible within those stacks.

LINSTOR can be used on its own or you can integrate it with other platforms, such as Kubernetes,
OpenShift, OpenNebula, OpenStack, Proxmox VE, and others. LINSTOR runs on bare-metal on-premise
hardware, or you can use it within virtual machines (VMs), containers, clouds, or hybrid
environments.

[[s-linstor-providers]]
==== LINSTOR supported storage and related technologies

LINSTOR can work with the following storage provider and related technologies:

- LVM and LVM thin volumes
- ZFS and ZFS thin volumes
- File and FileThin (loop devices)
- Diskless
- SPDK (remote)
- Microsoft Windows Storage Spaces and thin Storage Spaces
- EBS (target and initiator)
- Device mapper cache (`dm-cache`) and writecache (`dm-writecache`)
- bcache
- LUKS
- DRBD

By using LINSTOR, you can work with these technologies on their own or else in various
meaningful combinations.

=== How LINSTOR works

A working LINSTOR setup requires one active controller node that runs the LINSTOR
controller software as a systemd service, `linstor-controller.service`. This is the LINSTOR
control plane, where the LINSTOR controller node communicates with LINSTOR satellite nodes.

The setup also requires one or more satellite nodes that run the LINSTOR satellite software as a
systemd service, `linstor-satellite.service`. The LINSTOR satellite service facilitates storage and related actions on the node, for example creating storage volumes to provide data storage to users and applications. However, satellite nodes do not have to provide
physical storage to the cluster. For example, you can have _diskless_ satellite nodes that
participate in the LINSTOR cluster for DRBD quorum purposes.

NOTE: It is also possible for a node to run both the LINSTOR controller and satellite services and act
in a _Combined_ role.

You can think of the storage technologies as implemented on LINSTOR satellite nodes, for example, DRBD replication, as the data plane.
With LINSTOR, the control and data planes are separate and can function independently. This means, for
example, that you can update the LINSTOR controller node or the LINSTOR controller software while your LINSTOR satellite nodes continue
to provide (and replicate if using DRBD) storage to users and applications without interruption.

For convenience, a LINSTOR setup is often called a LINSTOR cluster in this guide, even though a
valid LINSTOR setup can exist as an integration within another platform, such as Kubernetes.

Users can interact with LINSTOR by using either a CLI-based client or a graphical user interface
(GUI). Both of these interfaces make use of
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Linstor/Linstor[the LINSTOR REST
API]. LINSTOR can integrate with other platforms and applications by using plugins or drivers
that also make use of this API.

Communication between the LINSTOR controller and the REST API happens via TCP/IP and can be
secured by using SSL/TLS.

The southbound drivers that LINSTOR uses to interface with physical storage are LVM, thinLVM and
ZFS.

image::images/linstor-how-it-works.svg[diagram of how LINSTOR works]

=== Installable components

A LINSTOR setup has three installable components:

* LINSTOR controller
* LINSTOR satellite
* LINSTOR user interfaces (LINSTOR client and LINBIT SDS GUI)

These installable components are either source code that you can compile, or else prebuilt
packages, that you can use to install and run the software.

==== LINSTOR controller

The `linstor-controller` service relies on a database that holds all the configuration
information for the whole cluster. A node or container running the LINSTOR controller software is responsible for resource placement,
resource configuration, and orchestration of any operational processes that require a view of
the whole cluster.

Multiple controllers can be used for LINSTOR, for example,
<<linstor-administration.adoc#s-linstor_ha, when setting up a highly available LINSTOR
cluster>>, but only one controller can be active.

As mentioned earlier, the LINSTOR controller operates on a separate plane from the data plane
that it manages. You can stop the controller service, update or reboot the controller node, and
still have access to your data hosted on the LINSTOR satellite nodes. While you can still access
and serve the data on your LINSTOR satellite nodes, without a running controller node, you will
not be able to perform any LINSTOR status or management tasks on the satellite nodes.

==== LINSTOR satellite

The `linstor-satellite` service runs on each node where LINSTOR consumes local storage or
provides storage to services. It is stateless and receives all the information it needs from the
node or container running the LINSTOR controller service. The LINSTOR satellite service runs programs like `lvcreate` and `drbdadm`. It acts
like an agent on a node or in a container that carries out instructions that it receives from the LINSTOR controller node or container.

==== LINSTOR user interfaces

When you need to interface with LINSTOR, you can send instructions to the active LINSTOR
controller by using one of its user interfaces (UIs): the LINSTOR client, or the LINBIT SDS GUI.

Both of these UIs rely on the LINSTOR
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Linstor/Linstor[REST API].

===== LINSTOR client

The LINSTOR client, `linstor`, is a command line utility that you can use to issue commands to
the active LINSTOR controller node. These commands can be action-oriented, such as commands that
create or modify storage resources in your cluster, or they can be status commands to glean
information about the current state of your LINSTOR cluster.

You can use the LINSTOR client either by entering `linstor` followed by valid commands and
arguments, or in the client's interactive mode, by entering `linstor` on its own.

You can find more information about using the LINSTOR client in the <<linstor-administration.adoc#s-using_the_linstor_client>> section in this user guide.

===== LINBIT SDS graphical user interface

The LINBIT SDS graphical user interface (GUI) is a web-based GUI that you can use to work with LINSTOR. It can be a
convenient way to navigate and get overview information about a LINSTOR cluster,
or add, modify, or delete LINSTOR objects within a cluster. For example, you can add nodes, add
or delete resources, or do other tasks.

You can find more information about using the GUI interface in the <<ch-linstor-gui,LINBIT SDS GUI chapter>> in this user guide.

[[s-concepts_and_terms]]
=== Internal components

The internal components of LINSTOR are abstractions of the software code that are used to describe
how LINSTOR works and how you use it. Examples of internal components would be LINSTOR objects,
such as resources or storage pools. Although these are abstractions, you will interact with them
in a very real way as you use either the LINSTOR client or GUI to deploy and manage storage.

Along the way, this section also introduces and explains core concepts and terms that you will
need to familiarize yourself with to understand how LINSTOR works and how to use it.

==== LINSTOR objects

LINSTOR takes an object-oriented approach to software-defined storage (SDS). LINSTOR objects are
the end result that LINSTOR presents to the user or application to consume or build upon.

The most commonly used LINSTOR objects are explained below and a full list of objects follows.

===== Resource

A resource is the LINSTOR object that represents consumable storage that is presented to
applications and end users. If LINSTOR is a factory, then a resource is the finished product
that it produces. Often, a resource is a DRBD replicated block device but it does not have to
be. For example, a resource could be diskless to satisfy DRBD quorum requirements, or it could
be an NVMe-oF or EBS initiator.

A resource has the following attributes:

* The name of the node that the resource exists on
* The resource definition that the resource belongs to
* Configuration properties of the resource

===== Volume

A volume is the closest LINSTOR internal component to physical storage and is a subset of a
resource. A resource can have multiple volumes. For example, you might want to have a database
stored on slower storage than its transaction log in a MySQL cluster. To accomplish this by
using LINSTOR, you could have one volume for the faster transaction log storage media and
another for the slower database storage media, and have both under a single "MySQL" resource. By
keeping multiple volumes under a single resource you are essentially creating a consistency
group.

An attribute that you specify for a volume takes precedence over the same attribute if it is
also specified "higher up" in the LINSTOR object hierarchy. This is because, again, a volume is
the closest internal LINSTOR object to physical storage.

===== Node

A Node is a server or container that participates in a LINSTOR cluster. The node
object has the following attributes:

* Name
* IP address
* TCP port
* Node type (controller, satellite, combined, auxiliary)
* Communication type (plain or SSL/TLS)
* Network interface type
* Network interface name

===== Storage pool

A storage pool identifies storage that is assignable to other LINSTOR objects, such as LINSTOR
resources, resource definitions, or resource groups, and can be consumed by LINSTOR volumes.

A storage pool defines:

* The storage back-end driver to use for the storage pool on the cluster node, for example, LVM,
thin-provisioned LVM, ZFS, and others
* The node that the storage pool exists on
* The storage pool name
* Configuration properties of the storage pool
* Additional parameters to pass to the storage pool's back-end driver (LVM, ZFS, and others)

==== Definition and group objects

While definitions and groups are also LINSTOR objects, they are a special kind. Definition and
group objects can be thought of as profiles or templates. These template objects are used to
create child objects that will inherit their parent object's attributes. They might also have attributes that can affect child objects but are not attributes of the child objects themselves. These attributes could be things such as the TCP port to use for DRBD replication or the volume number that a DRBD resource should use.

===== Definitions

Definitions define the attributes of an object. Objects created from a definition will inherit
the configuration attributes defined in the definition. A definition must be created before you
can create an associated child object. For example, you must create a resource definition prior
to creating the corresponding resource.

There are two LINSTOR definition objects that you can create directly, by using the LINSTOR
client: resource definitions and volume definitions.

Resource definition :::
Resource definitions can define the following attributes of a resource:
* The resource group that the resource definition belongs to
* The name of a resource (implicitly, by virtue of the resource definition's name)
* The TCP port to use for the resource's connection, for example, when DRBD is replicating data
* Other attributes such as a resource's storage layers, peer slots, and external name.

Volume definition :::
Volume definitions can define the following:

* The size of the storage volume
* The volume number of the storage volume (because a resource can have multiple volumes)
* The metadata properties of the volume
* The minor number to use for the DRBD device, if the volume is associated DRBD replicated
  storage

In addition to these definitions, LINSTOR has some indirect definitions: the storage pool
definition, the snapshot definition, and the snapshot volume definition. LINSTOR creates these
automatically when you create the respective object.

===== Groups

Groups are similar to definitions in that they are like profiles or templates. Where definitions
apply to LINSTOR object instances, groups apply to object definitions. As the name implies, a group can apply to multiple object definitions, just as a definition can apply to multiple object instances. For
example, you can have a resource group that defines resource attributes for a frequently needed
storage use case. You can then use the resource group to easily spawn (create) multiple
resources that need to have those attributes, without having to specify the attributes every
time you create a resource.

Resource group :::
A resource group is a parent object of a resource definition where all property changes made on
a resource group will be inherited by its resource definition childrenfootnote:[Property changes
made on a resource group will be inherited by its resource definition children and you will see
the changes reflected in the corresponding `.res` resource files. However, property changes made
on the parent are not copied to the child objects (either the resource definition or resource
LINSTOR objects), that is, the child objects do not carry the property themselves. The change
affects the object children, but the property itself remains on the parent.]. The resource group
also stores settings for automatic placement rules and can spawn a resource definition depending
on the stored rules.
+
A resource group defines characteristics of its resource definition child objects. A resource spawned from the resource group, or created from a resource definition that belongs to the resource group, will be a "grandchild" object of a
resource group and the "child" of a resource definition. Every resource definition
that you create will be a member of the default LINSTOR resource group, `DfltRscGrp`, unless you
specify another resource group when creating the resource definition.
+
Changes to a resource group will be applied to all resources or resource definitions that were
created from the resource group, retroactively, unless the same characteristic has been set on a
child object, for example, a resource definition or resource that was created from the resource
group.
+
All of this makes using resource groups a powerful tool to efficiently manage a large number of
storage resources. Rather than creating or modifying individual resources, you can simply
configure a resource group parent, and all the child resource objects will receive the
configuration.

Volume group :::
Similarly, volume groups are like profiles or templates for volume definitions. A volume group
must always reference a specific resource group. In addition, a volume group can define a volume
number, and a "gross" volume size.

[[s-linstor-introduction-linstor-object-hierarchy]]
=== LINSTOR object hierarchy

As alluded to in previous subsections of this chapter, there is a concept of hierarchy among
LINSTOR objects. Depending on the context, this can be described either as a parent-child
relationship, or else as a higher-lower relationship where lower means closer to the physical
storage layerfootnote:[Physical storage might not exist on a particular node, for example, a _diskless_ node. Here, the "physical storage" layer is imaginary, for the purposes of conceptualizing object hierarchy in LINSTOR.].

A child object will inherit attributes that are defined on its parent objects, if the
same attributes are not already defined on the child object. Similarly, a lower object will
receive attributes that are set on higher objects, if the same attributes are not
already defined on the lower object.

==== General rules for object hierarchy in LINSTOR

The following are some general rules for object hierarchy in LINSTOR:

- A LINSTOR object can only receive or inherit attributes that can be set on that object.
- Lower objects receive attributes set on higher objects.
- An attribute set on a lower object takes precedence over the same attribute set on higher
  objects.
- Child objects inherit attributes set on parent objects.
- An attribute set on a child object takes precedence over the same attribute set on parent
  objects.

==== Using diagrams to show relationships between LINSTOR objects

This section uses diagrams to represent the hierarchical relationships
between some of the most frequently used LINSTOR objects. Because of the number of LINSTOR
objects and their interconnectedness, multiple diagrams are shown first rather than a single
diagram, to simplify the conceptualization.

.The hierarchical relationships between common LINSTOR objects
image::images/linstor-object-hierarchy-ctrl-node-rsc-vlm.svg[Object hierarchy between controller, node, resource, and volume objects]

The next diagram shows the relationships between LINSTOR group objects on a single satellite node.

// diagram 2: Ctrl -> RG -> VG
.The hierarchical relationships between common LINSTOR group objects on a controller node
image::images/linstor-object-hierarchy-ctrl-rg-vg.svg[Object hierarchy between controller, resource group, and volume group objects]

While the two preceding diagrams show higher-lower relationships between common LINSTOR objects,
you can also think of some LINSTOR objects as having parent-child relationships. The next
diagram introduces this kind of relationship between LINSTOR objects by using a storage pool
definition (parent object) and a storage pool (child object) as an example. A parent object can
have multiple child objects, as shown in the following diagram.

.Higher-lower and parent-child relationships between LINSTOR objects
image::images/linstor-object-hierarchy-ctrl-spd-sp-vlm.svg[Diagram 3]

Having introduced the concept of parent-child relationships in a conceptual diagram, the next
diagram is a modified version of the second diagram with some of those relationships added for
groups and definitions. This modified diagram also incorporates some of the higher-lower
relationships that were shown in the first diagram.

.The hierarchical relationships between LINSTOR group and definition objects
image::images/linstor-object-hierarchy-ctrl-rg-vg-with-rd-r-vd-v.svg[Diagram 4]

The next diagram synthesizes the relationship concepts of the preceding diagrams while also
introducing new LINSTOR objects related to snapshots and connections. With the many objects and
criss-crossing lines, the reason for building up to this diagram should be apparent.

.The hierarchy and inheritance relationships of common LINSTOR objects
image::images/linstor-object-hierarchy-and-relationships.svg[diagram of LINSTOR hierarchy and inheritance relationships]

Even with its seeming complexity, the preceding diagram is still a simplification and not an
all-encompassing representation of the possible relationships between LINSTOR objects. As listed
earlier, there are more LINSTOR objects than are shown in the diagramfootnote:[Also, because
LINSTOR is evolving software, for some special use cases and contexts, it might be the case that
certain object property hierarchies are different from the general rules. When these cases occur
in documentation, there will be mention of any exceptions to the general rules.].

The good news is that you do not need to memorize the preceding diagram to work with LINSTOR. It
could be useful to refer to though if you are trying to troubleshoot attributes that you have
set on LINSTOR objects and their inheritance and effects on other LINSTOR objects in your
cluster.

=== Using LINSTOR

After introducing LINSTOR and explaining its basic concepts and functions, the next chapters in
this guide are how-to oriented and task-based. They provide instructions for using LINSTOR and
its various components to solve meaningful real-world data storage problems.
