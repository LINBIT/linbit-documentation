== Using DRBD Proxy

[[s-drbd-proxy-deployment-considerations]]
=== DRBD Proxy Deployment Considerations

The <<s-drbd-proxy,DRBD Proxy>> processes can either be located directly on the machines where
DRBD is set up, or they can be placed on distinct dedicated servers. A DRBD Proxy instance can
serve as a proxy for multiple DRBD devices distributed across multiple nodes.

DRBD Proxy is completely transparent to DRBD. Typically you will expect a high number of data
packets in flight, therefore the activity log should be reasonably large. Since this may cause
longer re-sync runs after the failure of a primary node, it is recommended to enable the DRBD
`csums-alg` setting.

For more information about the rationale for the DRBD Proxy, please see the feature explanation
<<s-drbd-proxy>>.

The DRBD Proxy 3 uses several kernel features that are only available since 2.6.26, so running
it on older systems (for example, RHEL 5) is not possible. Here we can still provide DRBD Proxy
1 packages, thoughfootnote:[The v1 uses a different scheduling model and will therefore not
reach the same performance as v3; so even if your production setup is still RHEL 5, perhaps you
can run one RHEL 6/7 VM in each data center?].


[[s-drbd-proxy-installation]]
=== Installing DRBD Proxy

To obtain DRBD Proxy, please contact your LINBIT sales representative. Unless instructed
otherwise, please always use the most recent DRBD Proxy release.

To install DRBD Proxy on Debian and Debian-based systems, use the dpkg tool as follows (replace
version with your DRBD Proxy version, and architecture with your target architecture):

----
# dpkg -i drbd-proxy_3.2.2_amd64.deb
----

To install DRBD Proxy on RPM based systems (like SLES or RHEL) use the RPM tool as follows
(replace version with your DRBD Proxy version, and architecture with your target architecture):

----
# rpm -i drbd-proxy-3.2.2-1.x86_64.rpm
----

Also install the DRBD administration program drbdadm since it is required to configure DRBD
Proxy.

This will install the DRBD Proxy binaries as well as an init script which usually goes into
`/etc/init.d`. Please always use the init script to start/stop DRBD proxy since it also
configures DRBD Proxy using the `drbdadm` tool.

[[s-drbd-proxy-license]]
=== License File

When obtaining a license from LINBIT, you will be sent a DRBD Proxy license file which is
required to run DRBD Proxy. The file is called `drbd-proxy.license`, it must be copied into the
`/etc` directory of the target machines, and be owned by the user/group `drbdpxy`.

----
# cp drbd-proxy.license /etc/
----

[[s-drbd-proxy-configuration-linstor]]
=== Configuring DRBD Proxy Using LINSTOR

DRBD Proxy can be configured using LINSTOR as described in the
link:https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/linstor-guide-1_0-en/[_LINSTOR User's Guide_].

[[s-drbd-proxy-configuration]]
=== Configuring DRBD Proxy Using Resource Files

DRBD Proxy can also be configured by editing resource files. It is configured by an additional
section called `proxy` and additional `proxy on` sections within the host sections.

Below is a DRBD configuration example for proxies running directly on the DRBD nodes:

[source,drbd]
----
resource r0 {
	protocol A;
	device     /dev/drbd15;
	disk       /dev/VG/r0;
	meta-disk  internal;

	proxy {
		memlimit 512M;
		plugin {
			zlib level 9;
		}
	}

	on alice {
		address 127.0.0.1:7915;
		proxy on alice {
			inside 127.0.0.1:7815;
			outside 192.168.23.1:7715;
		}
	}

	on bob {
		address 127.0.0.1:7915;
		proxy on bob {
			inside 127.0.0.1:7815;
			outside 192.168.23.2:7715;
		}
	}
}
----

The `inside` IP address is used for communication between DRBD and the DRBD Proxy, whereas the
`outside` IP address is used for communication between the proxies. The latter channel might
have to be allowed in your firewall setup.

[[s-drbd-proxy-controlling]]
=== Controlling DRBD Proxy

`drbdadm` offers the `proxy-up` and `proxy-down` subcommands to configure or delete the
connection to the local DRBD Proxy process of the named DRBD resource(s). These commands are
used by the `start` and `stop` actions which `/etc/init.d/drbdproxy` implements.

The DRBD Proxy has a low level configuration tool, called `drbd-proxy-ctl`. When called without
any option it operates in interactive mode.

To pass a command directly, avoiding interactive mode, use the `-c` parameter followed by the
command.

To display the available commands use:

----
# drbd-proxy-ctl -c "help"
----

Note the double quotes around the command being passed.


Here is a list of commands; while the first few ones are typically only used indirectly (via
`drbdadm proxy-up` resp. `drbdadm proxy-down`), the latter ones give various status information.

`add connection _<name>_ _lots of arguments_`:: Creates a communication path. As this is run via
`drbdadm proxy-up` the long list of arguments is omitted here.

`del connection  _<name>_`:: Removes a communication path.

`set memlimit _<name>_ _<memlimit-in-bytes>_`:: Sets the memory limit for a connection; this can
only be done when setting it up afresh, changing it during runtime is not possible. This
command understands the usual units `k`, `M`, and `G`.

`show`:: Shows currently configured communication paths.

`show memusage`:: Shows memory usage of each connection. For example, the following commands monitors memory usage:
+
----
# watch -n 1 'drbd-proxy-ctl -c "show memusage"'
----
+
IMPORTANT: The quotes around `show memusage` are required.

`show [h]subconnections`:: Shows currently established individual connections together with some
stats. With `h` outputs bytes in human readable format.

`show [h]connections`:: Shows currently configured connections and their states With `h` outputs
bytes in human readable format. The `Status` column will show one of these states:
+
* _Off_: No communication to the remote DRBD Proxy process.
* _Half-up_: The connection to the remote DRBD Proxy could be established; the Proxy => DRBD
  paths are not up yet.
* _DRBD-conn_: The first few packets are being pushed across the connection; but still for
  example a Split-Brain situation might serve it again.
* _Up_: The DRBD connection is fully established.

`shutdown`:: Shuts down the `drbd-proxy` program.
+
WARNING: This unconditionally terminates any DRBD connections that are using the DRBD proxy.

`quit`:: Exits the client program (closes the control connection), but leaves the DRBD proxy
running.

`print statistics`:: This prints detailed statistics for the currently active connections, in a
format that can be easily parsed. Use this for integration to your monitoring solution!
+
NOTE: While the commands above are only accepted from UID 0 (that is, the `root` user), this one
can be used by any user (provided that UNIX permissions allow access on the proxy socket at
`/var/run/drbd-proxy/drbd-proxy-ctl.socket`). Refer to the init script at
`/etc/init.d/drbdproxy` about setting the permissions.

[[s-drbd-proxy-plugins]]
=== About DRBD Proxy Plugins

Since DRBD Proxy version 3 the proxy allows to enable a few specific plugins for the WAN
connection. The currently available plugins are `zstd`, `lz4`, `zlib`, and `lzma` (all software
compression).

`zstd` (Zstandard) is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios. It
offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast
decoder. Compression rates are dependent on "level" parameter which can be arranged between 1 to
22. Over level 20, DRBD Proxy will require more memory.

`lz4` is a very fast compression algorithm; the data typically gets compressed down by 1:2 to
1:4, half- to two-thirds of the bandwidth can be saved.

The `zlib` plugin uses the GZIP algorithm for compression; it uses a bit more CPU than `lz4`,
but gives a ratio of 1:3 to 1:5.

The `lzma` plugin uses the `liblzma2` library. It can use dictionaries of several hundred MiB;
these allow for very efficient delta-compression of repeated data, even for small changes.
`lzma` needs much more CPU and memory, but results in much better compression than `zlib` --
real-world tests with a VM sitting on top of DRBD gave ratios of 1:10 to 1:40. The `lzma` plugin
has to be enabled in your license.

Contact LINBIT to find the best settings for your environment - it depends on the CPU (speed,
number of threads), available memory, input and available output bandwidth, and expected I/O
spikes. Having a week of `sysstat` data already available helps in determining the
configuration, too.

NOTE: Older `compression on` in the `proxy` section is deprecated, and will be removed in
a future release. Currently it is treated as `zlib level 9`.

[[s-drbd-proxy-bwlimit]]
=== Using a WAN-side Bandwidth Limit

You can use the Linux kernel's traffic control framework to limit bandwidth consumed by DRBD Proxy
on the WAN side.

In the following example you would need to replace the interface name, the source port and the
IP address of the peer.

----
# tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: htb default 1
# tc class add dev eth0 parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate 1gbit
# tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:1 classid 1:10 htb rate 500kbit
# tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 16 u32 \
        match ip sport 7000 0xffff \
        match ip dst 192.168.47.11 flowid 1:10
# tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 16 u32 \
        match ip dport 7000 0xffff \
        match ip dst 192.168.47.11 flowid 1:10
----

You can remove this bandwidth limitation with:

----
# tc qdisc del dev eth0 root handle 1
----

WARNING: DRBD Proxy version 3 has an experimental `bwlimit` option. Do not use
it, as it might cause applications on top of DRBD to block on I/O.

[[s-drbd-proxy-troubleshoot]]
=== Troubleshooting

DRBD Proxy logs events through syslog using the `LOG_DAEMON` facility. Usually you will find
DRBD Proxy events in `/var/log/daemon.log`.

Enabling debug mode in DRBD Proxy can be done with the following command.

----
# drbd-proxy-ctl -c 'set loglevel debug'
----

For example, if proxy fails to connect it will log something like `Rejecting connection because
I can't connect on the other side`. In that case, please check if DRBD is running (not in
StandAlone mode) on both nodes and if both proxies are running. Also double-check your
configuration.
