== Optimizing DRBD throughput

This chapter deals with optimizing DRBD throughput. It examines some
hardware considerations with regard to throughput optimization, and
details tuning recommendations for that purpose.

[[s-throughput-hardware]]
=== Hardware considerations

DRBD throughput is affected by both the bandwidth of the underlying
I/O subsystem (disks, controllers, and corresponding caches), and the
bandwidth of the replication network.

.I/O subsystem throughput
indexterm:[throughput]I/O subsystem throughput is determined, largely,
by the number and type of storage units (disks, SSDs, other Flash storage [like 
FusionIO], ...) that can be written to in parallel. A single,
reasonably recent, SCSI or SAS disk will typically allow streaming
writes of roughly 40MiB/s to the single disk; an SSD will do 300MiB/s;
one of the recent Flash storages (NVMe) will be at 1GiB/s. When deployed in a
striping configuration, the I/O subsystem will parallelize writes
across disks, effectively multiplying a single disk's throughput by
the number of stripes in the configuration. Thus the same, 40MB/s
disks will allow effective throughput of 120MB/s in a RAID-0 or
RAID-1+0 configuration with three stripes, or 200MB/s with five
stripes; with SSDs and/or NVMe you can easily get to 1GiB/sec.

A RAID-controller with RAM and a <<s-hardware-bbu,BBU>> can speed up short 
spikes (by buffering them), and so too-short benchmark tests might show speeds
like 1GiB/s too; for sustained writes its buffers will just run full,
and then not be of much help, though.


NOTE: Disk _mirroring_ (RAID-1) in hardware typically has little, if
any, effect on throughput. Disk _striping with parity_ (RAID-5) does
have an effect on throughput, usually an adverse one when compared to
striping; RAID-5 and RAID-6 in software even more so.

.Network throughput
indexterm:[throughput]Network throughput is usually determined by the
amount of traffic present on the network, and on the throughput of any
routing/switching infrastructure present. These concerns are, however,
largely irrelevant in DRBD replication links which are normally
dedicated, back-to-back network connections. Thus, network throughput
may be improved either by switching to a higher-throughput hardware
(such as 10 Gigabit Ethernet, or 56GiB Infiniband), or by using link aggregation over
several network links, as one may do using the Linux
indexterm:[bonding driver]`bonding` network driver.

[[s-throughput-overhead-expectations]]
=== Throughput overhead expectations

When estimating the throughput overhead associated with DRBD, it is
important to consider the following natural limitations:

* DRBD throughput is limited by that of the raw I/O subsystem.
* DRBD throughput is limited by the available network bandwidth.

The _lower_ of these two establishes the theoretical throughput
_maximum_ available to DRBD. DRBD then reduces that throughput number
by its additional overhead, which can be expected to be
less than 3 percent.

* Consider the example of two cluster nodes containing I/O subsystems
  capable of 600 MB/s throughput, with a Gigabit Ethernet link
  available between them. Gigabit Ethernet can be expected to produce
  110 MB/s throughput for TCP connections, thus the network connection
  would be the bottleneck in this configuration and one would
  expect about 110 MB/s maximum DRBD throughput.

* By contrast, if the I/O subsystem is capable of only 80 MB/s for
  sustained writes, then it constitutes the bottleneck, and you should
  expect only about 77 MB/s maximum DRBD throughput.


[[s-throughput-tuning]]
=== Tuning recommendations

DRBD offers a number of configuration options which may have an effect
on your system's throughput. This section list some recommendations
for tuning for throughput. However, since throughput is largely
hardware dependent, the effects of tweaking the options described here
may vary greatly from system to system. It is important to understand
that these recommendations should not be interpreted as "silver
bullets" which would magically remove any and all throughput
bottlenecks.

[[s-tune-max-buffer-max-epoch-size]]
==== Setting `max-buffers` and `max-epoch-size`

These options affect write performance on the secondary
nodes. `max-buffers` is the maximum number of buffers DRBD allocates for
writing data to disk while `max-epoch-size` is the maximum number of
write requests permitted between two write barriers. `max-buffers` must be 
equal or bigger to `max-epoch-size` to increase performance.
The default for both is 2048; setting it to around
8000 should be fine for most reasonably high-performance hardware RAID
controllers.

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  net {
    max-buffers    8000;
    max-epoch-size 8000;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

[[s-tune-sndbuf-size]]
==== Tuning the TCP send buffer size

The TCP send buffer is a memory buffer for outgoing TCP traffic. By
default, it is set to a size of 128 KiB. For use in high-throughput
networks (such as dedicated Gigabit Ethernet or load-balanced bonded
connections), it may make sense to increase this to a size of 2MiB,
or perhaps even more. Send buffer sizes of more than 16MiB are
generally not recommended (and are also unlikely to produce any
throughput improvement).

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  net {
    sndbuf-size 2M;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

DRBD also supports TCP send buffer auto-tuning. After enabling this
feature, DRBD will dynamically select an appropriate TCP send buffer
size. TCP send buffer auto tuning is enabled by simply setting the
buffer size to zero:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  net {
    sndbuf-size 0;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

Please note that your ``sysctl``'s settings `net.ipv4.tcp_rmem` and
`net.ipv4.tcp_wmem` will still influence the behaviour; you should check
these settings, and perhaps set them similar to `131072 1048576 16777216`
(minimum 128kiB, default 1MiB, max 16MiB).

WARNING: `net.ipv4.tcp_mem` is a different beast, with a different unit -
do not touch, wrong values can easily push your machine into out-of-memory 
situations!

[[s-tune-al-extents]]
==== Tuning the Activity Log size

If the application using DRBD is write intensive in the sense that it
frequently issues small writes scattered across the device, it is
usually advisable to use a fairly large activity log. Otherwise,
frequent metadata updates may be detrimental to write performance.

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  disk {
    al-extents 6007;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------

////
For tuning on striped RAID setups, please see the <<al-stripes,al-stripes>> and 
<<al-stripe-size,al-stripe-size>> settings, too.
////

[[s-tune-disable-barriers]]
==== Disabling barriers and disk flushes

WARNING: The recommendations outlined in this section should be applied
_only_ to systems with non-volatile (battery backed) controller caches.

Systems equipped with battery backed write cache come with built-in
means of protecting data in the face of power failure. In that case,
it is permissible to disable some of DRBD's own safeguards created for
the same purpose. This may be beneficial in terms of throughput:

[source,drbd]
----------------------------
resource <resource> {
  disk {
    disk-barrier no;
    disk-flushes no;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
----------------------------


[[s-tune-read-balancing]]
=== Achieving better Read Performance via increased Redundancy

As detailed in the man page of `drbd.conf` under `read-balancing`,
you can increase your read performance by adding more copies of your data.

As a ballpark figure: with a single node processing read requests, `fio` on 
a __FusionIO__ card gave us 100k IOPs; after enabling `read-balancing`, the 
performance jumped to 180k IOPs, ie. +80%!

So, in case you're running a read-mostly workload (big databases with lots of 
random reads), it might be worth a try to turn `read-balancing` on - and, 
perhaps, add another copy for still more read IO throughput.
